born in Blackhill Seed was brought up in the village of Whitburn on the coast 
just to the north of Sunderland the family moving when Jimmy was two years old 
On leaving school at Seed worked at Whitburn colliery and when he reached played football 
in the Wearside League for Whitburn along with his brother Angus who would have a 
short professional career with Leicester After scoring over goals for Whitburn Jimmy had unsuccessful trials 
at South Shields and However Sunderland manager Bob Kyle decided to give Seed a second 
chance this time playing him at inside right instead of centre forward in a North 
Eastern League match against Wallsend Seed scored a hattrick in the match and was promptly 
signed by Sunderland as a professional in April Seed spent the season playing in Sunderland 
he scored plenty of goals as the team lifted the Durham Senior Cup Official League 
football was suspended at the end of that season because of the outbreak of World 
War I At the end of the season the Seed joined the Army Cyclist In 
the summer of he was drafted to France with the battalion of the West Yorkshire 
Seed suffered with depression after his arrival and in July he was gassed when a 
German aeroplane dropped mustard gas bombs on a house in Nieuwpoort Belgium in which he 
was He returned to England to convalesce and returned to France in August until being 
evacuated after being gassed in Valenciennes France two months With the cessation of hostilities Seed 
played a Victory League match for Sunderland against Durham City in however his lungs were 
weak and he had a poor On the strength of that performance the Sunderland directors 
decided that Seed's wartime experience had finished him as a footballer and gave him a 
free Seed never played an official first team game for Sunderland Seed was discharged from 
the army in March Seed's football career was rescued by Haydn Price former Wales international 
the manager of Welsh nonLeague team Mid Rhondda who were based in the town of 
Tonypandy Price offered Seed a chance to play for the South Wales club which was 
accepted and he signed for them in July Seed joined former England international Joe Bache 
and exteammate from Sunderland Frank Pattison in the MidRhondda side and they had a successful 
time in the seven months that Seed was with them winning both the Southern League 
Division Two and Welsh League Seed's good form attracted the attention of Tottenham Hotspur manager 
Peter McWilliam and in January he signed for the north London side for a fee 
of a move which caused some antagonism amongst supporters in After initially playing five games 
in the reserves Seed got his first team chance with Spurs making his debut at 
inside right and forming an immediate understanding with the legendary diminutive right winger Fanny Walden 
Seed played five games in the remainder of the season scoring two goals as Spurs 
ran away with the Division Two title Seed was a virtual ever present for Spurs 
in the following seven seasons in Division One The season saw Tottenham lift the FA 
Cup with Seed playing in all six matches in the cup run scoring five goals 
including a hat trick against Bradford City in the second round Just two months after 
getting his cup winners medal Seed was called up for the first of this five 
England caps on May against Belgium he never got a long run in the international 
side playing his final game in April saw Tottenham finish runners up to Liverpool in 
Division One with Seed scoring goals in appearances In February Peter McWilliam resigned as Spurs 
manager being replaced by Billy Minter Minter obviously thought the Seed was reaching the end 
of his career with a young Taffy O'Callaghan ready to take his place he promptly 
cut Seed's wages from to a week Seeds reaction to this was to ask to 
be released by the club at the end of the season and after looking like 
taking the playermanagers job at Aldershot he eventually signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a part 
exchange deal involving Darkie Lowdell and a cash adjustment paid by Seed made his Wednesday 
debut on August in the first match of the season against Everton During the first 
part of the season Seed was asked to play in numerous different positions by manager 
Bob Brown as Wednesday struggled in Division One By mid March they had won only 
six matches out of and were seven points adrift at the foot of the table 
At that stage Seed was made team captain with existing skipper Fred Keen being dropped 
Ellis Rimmer was bought from Tranmere Rovers and these changes triggered an amazing recovery Wednesday 
picked up points out of a possible in the last ten matches and avoided relegation 
by a point The irony was that it was Seed's old club Tottenham who were 
relegated on the final day of the season By his own admission Seed did not 
play his best football of his career at Wednesday but his experience and knowhow as 
captain was the catalyst that drove a young and talented Wednesday side to two successive 
Division One championships in the following two seasons and making this the most successful period 
in the club's He played in Sheffield Wednesday's defeat by Arsenal in the Charity Shield 
at Stamford Bridge in October Seed played four seasons at Hillsborough but by the season 
aged he was badly hampered by a knee injury and was often limping before the 
end of the games he often played even though he was not fully fit because 
of his talismanic influence on the team After damaging the ligaments in his right knee 
in a match against Newcastle United at Christmas he realised his playing days were numbered 
but he didn't retire until the end of the season He then took up an 
offer from Herbert Chapman to manage Clapton Orient which Chapman intended to become Arsenal's nursery 
He played for the "Professionals" in the FA Charity Seed began his managerial career at 
Clapton Orient He was tempted into the job by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman who told 
Seed that Arsenal had plans to buy Orient and turn them into a nursery club 
for Arsenal Seed commenced the job at a week but within a short time Arsenal 
were forced to abandon their plans after being told by the Football League that they 
were unlawful Without the financial backing of Arsenal Orient had very little money and the 
team struggled In Seed's first season as manager the team finished and then in the 
following campaign they avoided having to seek reelection on goal average In May he accepted 
the offer of the manager's job at Charlton Athletic despite Sheffield Wednesday trying to tempt 
Seed back to Hillsborough as a replacement for the manager Bob Brown Between and he 
led Charlton to successive promotions from the Third Division to the First Division In Charlton's 
first season in the topflight they finished runnersup behind Manchester City in They finished third 
and fourth in the final two seasons before the outbreak of the Second World War 
He led the team into a variety of regional competitions set up during the war 
and Charlton reached a Wembley final for the first time in They were beaten by 
Arsenal in the War Cup They were more successful in when captain Don Welsh lifted 
the trophy following a triumph over Chelsea They contested the first two postwar FA Cup 
finals at Wembley which were noted for the ball bursting on both occasions They were 
well beaten by Derby County in but a Chris Duffy goal beat Burnley in Despite 
the revenues generated by very large home attendances Charlton wouldn't allow Seed to invest in 
new players he 'discovered' Stanley Matthews but wasn't allowed to sign and so The Addicks 
were unable to repeat their prewar success in the First Division finishing no higher than 
ninth in the initial six seasons after the conflict They narrowly missed relegation in with 
a position finish but they finished fifth in Following two bottomhalfofthetable finishes Seed endured a 
dreadful start to the season losing their first five matches before being asked for his 
resignation in September The South Stand at The Valley Charlton's home ground is named after 
Seed After Charlton had turned down his request to become a Director he became an 
advisor at Bristol City in January he took over as caretaker manager in January for 
a short while after Pat Beasley had left the club When new Bristol boss Peter 
Doherty took over Seed moved to manage Millwall in the early months of He got 
off to a terrible start at The Old Den going nine matches without a win 
The team eventually finished in Division Three South having to apply for reelection The following 
season saw Millwall playing in the new Football League Fourth Division eventually finishing Seed stepped 
down as Millwall manager at the end of the campaign but stayed with the club 
as advisor and then as a club director He continued as a director of Millwall

Archibald Joseph Cronin July January was a Scottish physician and His bestknown novel The Citadel 
tells of a Scottish doctor in a Welsh mining village who quickly moves up the 
career ladder in London Cronin had observed the venues as a medical inspector of mines 
and later as a doctor in Harley Street The book promoted still controversial ideas about 
medical ethics and helped to inspire the National Health Service Another popular mining novel of 
Cronin's set in the North East of England is The Stars Look Down Both have 
been adapted as films as have Hatter's Castle The Keys of the Kingdom and The 
Green Years Cronin's novel Country Doctor was adapted as a longrunning BBC radio and TV 
series Dr Finlay's Casebook revived many years later Cronin was born in Cardross Scotland the 
only child of a Presbyterian mother Jessie Cronin née Montgomerie and a Catholic father Patrick 
Cronin Cronin often wrote of young men from similarly mixed backgrounds His paternal grandparents had 
emigrated from County Armagh Ireland and become glass and china merchants in Alexandria Owen Cronin 
his grandfather had had his surname changed from Cronague in His maternal grandfather Archibald Montgomerie 
was a hatter who owned a shop in Dumbarton After their marriage Cronin's parents moved 
to Helensburgh where he attended Grant Street School When he was seven years old his 
father an insurance agent and commercial traveller died from tuberculosis He and his mother moved 
to her parents' home in Dumbarton and she soon became a public health inspector in 
Glasgow Cronin was not only a precocious student at Dumbarton who won prizes in writing 
competitions but an excellent athlete and footballer From an early age he was an avid 
golfer and he enjoyed the sport throughout his life He also loved salmon fishing The 
family later moved to Yorkhill Glasgow where Cronin attended St Aloysius' in the Garnethill area 
of the city He played football for the First XI there an experience he included 
in one of his last novels The Minstrel Boy A family decision that he should 
study either to join the church or to practise medicine was settled by Cronin himself 
when he chose "the lesser of two He won a Carnegie scholarship to study medicine 
at the University of Glasgow in Having been absent in for naval service he graduated 
in with highest honours in the degree of MBChB Later that year he visited India 
as ship's surgeon on a liner Cronin went on to earn additional qualifications including a 
Diploma in Public Health and Membership of the Royal College of Physicians In he was 
awarded an MD by the University of Glasgow for a dissertation entitled "The History of 
Aneurysm" During the First World War Cronin served as a surgeon sublieutenant in the Royal 
Navy Volunteer Reserve before graduating from medical school After the war he trained at various 
hospitals including Bellahouston Hospital and Lightburn Hospital in Glasgow and the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin 
He undertook general practice in a small village on the Clyde Garelochhead and in Tredegar 
a mining town in South Wales In he was appointed Medical Inspector of Mines for 
Great Britain His survey of medical regulations in collieries and his reports on the correlation 
between coaldust inhalation and pulmonary disease were published over the next few years Cronin drew 
on his medical experience and research on the occupational hazards of the mining industry for 
his later novels – The Citadel set in Wales and The Stars Look Down set 
in Northumberland He subsequently moved to London where he practised in Harley Street before opening 
a thriving medical practice of his own in Notting Hill Cronin was also the medical 
officer for the Whiteleys department store at this time and becoming increasingly interested in ophthalmology 
In Cronin was diagnosed with a chronic duodenal ulcer and told that must take six 
months' complete rest in the country on a milk diet At Dalchenna Farm by Loch 
Fyne he was finally able to indulge his lifelong desire to write a novel having 
previously "written nothing but prescriptions and scientific From Dalchenna Farm he travelled to Dumbarton to 
research the background of his first novel using the files of Dumbarton Library which still 
has a letter from Cronin requesting advice He composed Hatter's Castle in the span of 
three months and the manuscript was quickly accepted by Gollancz the only publishing house to 
which it had been submitted apparently chosen by his wife sticking a pin into a 
list of publishers at The novel was an immediate and sensational success launching Cronin's career 
as a prolific author He never returned to practising medicine Many of Cronin's books were 
bestsellers in their day and translated into many languages Some of his stories draw on 
his medical career dramatically mixing realism romance and social criticism Cronin's works examine moral conflicts 
between the individual and society as his idealistic heroes pursue justice for the common man 
One of his early novels The Stars Look Down chronicles transgressions in a mining community 
in northeast England and an ambitious miner's rise to be a Member of Parliament A 
prodigiously fast writer Cronin liked to average words a day meticulously planning the details of 
his plots in He was known to be tough in business dealings although in private 
life he was a person whose "pawky humour peppered his conversations" according to one of 
his editors Peter Cronin also contributed stories and essays to various international publications During the 
Second World War he worked for the British Ministry of Information writing articles as well 
as participating in radio broadcasts to foreign countries The Citadel a tale of a mining 
company doctor's struggle to balance scientific integrity with social obligations helped to promote the establishment 
of the National Health Service NHS in the United Kingdom by exposing the inequity and 
incompetence of medical practice at the time In the novel Cronin advocated a free public 
health service in order to defeat the wiles of doctors who "raised guineasnatching and the 
bamboozling of patients to an art Dr Cronin and Aneurin Bevan had both worked at 
the Tredegar Cottage Hospital in Wales which served as one of the bases for the 
NHS The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession and there was a concerted 
effort by one group of specialists to get The Citadel banned Cronin's novel which was 
the highestselling book ever published by Victor Gollancz informed the public about corruption within the 
medical system planting a seed that eventually led to reform Not only were the author's 
pioneering ideas instrumental in the creation of the NHS but the historian Raphael Samuel asserted 
in that the popularity of Cronin's novels played a major role in the Labour Party's 
landslide victory in By contrast one of Cronin's biographers Alan Davies called the book's reception 
mixed A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to 
one of its many messages that a few wellheeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping 
off their equally welloff patients Some pointed to a lack of balance between criticism and 
praise for hardworking doctors The majority accepted it for what it was a topical novel 
The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy 
while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book all overlooking the 
fact that it was a work of fiction not a scientific piece of research and 
not autobiographical In the United States The Citadel won the National Book Award Favorite Fiction 
of voted by members of the American Booksellers According to a Gallup poll conducted in 
The Citadel was voted the most interesting book readers had ever Some of Cronin's novels 
also deal with religion which he had grown away from during his medical training and 
career but to which he became reacquainted in the At medical school as he recounts 
in his autobiography he had become an agnostic "When I thought of God it was 
with a superior smile indicative of biological scorn for such an outworn myth" During his 
practice in Wales however the deep religious faith of the people he worked among made 
him start to wonder whether "the compass of existence held more than my textbooks had 
revealed more than I had ever dreamed of In short I lost my superiority and 
this though I was not then aware of it is the first step towards finding 
God" Cronin also came to feel that "If we consider the physical universe we cannot 
escape the notion of a primary Creator Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species 
its scientific doctrine of natural causes And still you are confronted with the same mystery 
primary and profound Ex nihilo nihil as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it 
nothing can come of nothing" This was brought home to him in London where in 
his spare time he had organised a working boys' club One day he invited a 
distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members The speaker adopting "a frankly atheistic 
approach" described the sequence of events leading to the emergence "though he did not say 
how" of the first primitive lifeform from lifeless matter When he concluded there was polite 
applause Then "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet" and with 
a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place The 
naïve question took everyone by surprise The lecturer "looked annoyed hesitated slowly turned red Then 
before he could answer the whole club burst into a howl of laughter The elaborate 
structure of logic offered by the testtube realist had been crumpled by one word of 
challenge from a simpleminded It was at university that Cronin met his future wife Agnes 
Mary Gibson May who was also a medical student She was the daughter of Robert 
Gibson a master baker and Agnes Thomson Gibson née Gilchrist of Hamilton Lanarkshire The couple 
married on August As a physician May worked with her husband briefly in the dispensary 
while he was employed by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society; she also assisted him with 
his practice in London When he became an author she would proofread his manuscripts Their 
first son Vincent was born in Tredegar in Their second son Patrick was born in 
London in Andrew their youngest son was born in London in With his stories being 
adapted for Hollywood films Cronin and his family moved to the United States in living

in tournaments organized by In Forza and Coraggio members decided to set up a team 
which could finally dispute the Italian Championshipclarification needed It happened on February with the foundation

in Novara of which the score was In the same year businessman Giovanni Maino offered 
eleven grey shirts similar to those worn by his famous cycling team to Alessandria In 
the team recruited the English playercoach George Arthur Smith coming from the ranks of Genoa; 
he proved to be a great football teacher and thanks to him talented players like 
Adolfo Baloncieri and Carlo Carcano—who in the coached Juventus FC in the "Quinquennio d'Oro" period 
and who became on January the first Alessandria footballer wearing the national football team's jersey—soon 
exploded in the Already in the season the grey team in Piedmont was very good

lost the chance to qualify for the Northern Italy final losing to US Pro Vercelli 
in a violent match bitterly contested by Alessandria they chose to withdraw in protest after 
just an hour of play after a serious head injury occurred in needed In subsequent 
years Alessandria US continued to show excellent performances but never succeeded in winning a championship 
as the tournament was dominated by Pro Vercelli and Genoa from Bologna CFC and Turinese 
teams In after a disappointing season after which the salvation from relegation in Division I 
came only after a series of playouts against Pisa Legnano and Novara came the first 
trophy the Coppa CONI won after a double final played against Casale in Casale Monferrato 
and in In the first round Alessandria which was trained by Carlo Carcano defeated Livorno 
Andrea Doria Brescia Alba Rome and Napoli Later that year the works for the new

which in the summer of signed for Torino FC In Alessandria came close to winning 
the championship; after qualifying for the eightteam final round they started to fight for the 
title against Baloncieri's Torino It was a heavy unexpected defeat at Casale that erased the 
dreams of Carcano's team for it wasn't enough to defeat Torino in the direct match 
to win the championship Alessandria's Goalkeeper Curti suspected by most of illicit activities was soon 
expelled Furthermore authorities already heavily discredited after the "Allemandi Case" deemed it unnecessary to investigate 
further into the At the end of the season Alessandria was admitted to the first 
edition of Serie A tournament place and finally inaugurated the new In the early several 
players left the club still tied to amateurism to migrate to large centers; Carcano Ferrari 
and Bertolini signed for Juventus and Allesandria greatly lost its potential not gaining anything but 
middleranking positions In the team after beating Cremonese Modena Lazio and Milan joined the Coppa 
Italia final played in Genoa on June and lost to Torino In the summer of 
SS Lazio who was trying to set up a team which could win the championship 
offered the team the considerable amount of Italian lire for the three promising midfielders Busani 
Riccardi and Alessandria managers agreed but the team was no longer up to expectations and 
fell for the first time in Serie B at the end of season The first 
Serie B championship ended with a new disappointment for Alessandria which after leading for much 
of the tournament fell in the final games suffering defeats from Modena and Novara In 
subsequent years Alessandria was unable to fight effectively for the promotion; in the championships were 
suspended due to the outbreak of World War II In the season Alessandria led by 
coaches Renato Cattaneo and Mario Sperone obtained the return in Serie A The team remained 
in Serie A for two seasons and on May the club suffered the heaviest defeat 
ever by a team in Italian Serie A history losing against Torino At the end 
of that championship they returned to Serie B In the Alessandria was the subject of 
a curious incident when before a game against Venezia the referee ordered that Alessandria change 
uniforms because in his view the gray shirt was indistinguishable from the black one of 
the opponents After the match FIGC asked the arbitrator to undergo an eye examination which 
determined that he was colorblind a test then became mandatory for all Also in those 
years the club launched the young talent Gino Armano In the late and during the 
early Alessandria alternated years of Serie B to the first championships in Serie C following 
the unfortunate relegation of A few months after the beginning of the presidency of the 
Sacco family Alessandria returned to Serie A It happened at the end of the season 
after having successfully completed the comeback on Catania and later defeating Brescia in extra time 
in a qualification match If in the first decades of its existence the club found 
its force in its brilliant forwards this period proved to be an excellent interpreter of 
the socalled catenaccio In a young Gianni Rivera debuted in Serie Also in the same 
year Alessandria played its first match in an international competition facing the Velež Mostar in 
Mitropa Cup This happy period for the Alessandria club ended after relegation In the they 
declined in Serie C and in the early failed several times in earning a promotion 
to Serie B In the club won the first edition of the Coppa Italia Serie 
C defeating Avellino in the final match At the end of the championships the club 
were promoted to Serie B; that season ended up in a frantic way with coach 
Dino Ballacci being sacked and the subsequent resignation of chairman Sacco disputed by supporters In 
after losing a relegation playoff against Reggiana Alessandria returned to Serie C Since that moment 
they became a fixture in that category for almost thirty years In the season the 
club which was suffering economically after the abandonment of the Calleri family was sustained for 
a period by Massese chairman who was planning to extend his interests in the club 
he had tried to negotiate with the leaders of Prato and Carrarese in that dramatic 
situation Alessandria relegated for the first time in regional categories though they improved in the 
summer of before losing to Montebelluna In that same year the head of Alessandria became 
the founder of AGV Gino Amisano who was head of the club for almost fifteen 
years; in this period the team gained two promotions in Serie in and and obtained 
economical support from the clothing company Kappa In Serie the club obtained good results but 
never challenged for promotion; in after a hard championship Alessandria fell again to Serie beaten 
in the relegation playoff by Pistoiese After the season hopes of promotion subsided the following 
year due to declining performances The next several years were especially turbulent for the club 
as the Spinelli family struggled with their Alessandria was dropped to the amateur leagues and 
the club was declared bankrupt in Despite the strong opposition of Alessandria a new club 
called Nuova Alessandria was founded; it took part in the Eccellenza championship In a consortium 
of local businessmen purchased the original brand Ever since the season the club took part 
in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione championship In the summer of it was relegated by

The Welsh Church Act is an Act under which the Church of England was separated 
and disestablished in Wales and Monmouthshire leading to the creation of the Church in Wales 
The act had long been demanded by the Nonconformist element in Wales which composed the 
majority of the population and which resented paying taxes to the Anglican Church of England 
It was sponsored by the Liberal party the stronghold of the Nonconformists and opposed by 
the Conservative party the stronghold of the The Act which took effect in was a 
controversial measure and was passed by the House of Commons under the provisions of the 
Parliament Act which minimized the ability of the House of Lords to block it The 
main financial terms were that the Church no longer receive tithe money a land tax 
but kept all its churches properties and The Bill was politically and historically significant as 
one of the first pieces of legislation to apply solely to Wales and Monmouthshire as 
opposed to the wider legal entity of England and In Wales the passing of the 
Bill was the culmination of a long campaign which had begun in the midnineteenth century 
led largely by Welsh Nonconformists such as Calvinistic Methodists Baptists Unitarians and other Protestant groups 
which objected to paying tithes to the Church of England The campaign was later strongly 
supported by the patriotic Cymru Fydd movement English Catholic author G K Chesterton ridiculed the 
passion that was generated by the Bill in his poem Antichrist or the Reunion of 
Christendom An Ode repeatedly addressing F E Smith one of the chief opponents of the 
act Owing to the outbreak of the First World War in August the Act was 
given Royal Assent on September simultaneously with another controversial bill the Government of Ireland Act 
In addition Royal Assent was also given to the Suspensory Act which stated that the 
two other Acts would not come into force for the remainder of the war On

Police departments in the University of California system are charged with providing law enforcement to 
each of the system's campuses The University of California was established in and moved its 
first campus to Berkeley in The San Francisco and Los Angeles campuses followed in and 
respectively The original UCPD department at Berkeley was founded after World War II In September 
the Regents of the University of California established UCPD as a state lawenforcement agency The 
UCPD is one of several police agencies in California having a statewide jurisdiction and authority 
other examples include the California Highway Patrol the California State University Police Department and the 
California Department of Fish and Game UCPD officers like most California police officers are empowered 
by section of the California Penal Code giving them authority as duly sworn peace officers 
throughout the state of As specified by Section of the California Education Code their primary 
jurisdiction extends to the campuses and properties owned by the Regents of the University of 
California as well as lands within a onemile radius of those The department consists of 
ten departments one for each UC each led by its own chief of police Unlike 
other police departments in the state there is no single chief of the UCPD however 
one chief is selected as the department's central coordinator currently Chief David S Rose of 
UCSD The coordinator is responsible for compiling crime statistics from each campus as required by 
the Clery Act and for ensuring that the various departments are operating within the UCPD's 
mission However the coordinator does not dictate the daytoday operations of the department and each 
department sets its own Standard Operating Policies Still the UCPD is more coordinated than this 
organization would suggest The department shares a central mission and philosophy including that of community 
oriented policing The departments maintain communication with each other and frequently call upon each other 
for mutual aid which is facilitated by a department standard uniform and duty gear including 
using the same trunked radio system at all departments allowing personnel to use their issued 
radios at any campus Since October UCPD officers wear LAPDstyle dark blue uniforms with departmental 
patches; their previous uniforms were California Highway Patrolstyle tan The badge is a gold sevenpoint 
star with a colored California state seal in the center a common badge style used 
by various other state agencies Almost all of the departments have a Community Service Officer 
CSO program CSOs are nonsworn student employees that perform various tasks for the department Although 
their job description varies slightly from department to department most utilize CSOs to perform night 
escorts building checks and general citizen assistance Because CSOs have no legal authority their main 
purpose is to act as additional "eyes and ears" of the department Seven of the 
ten UCPD departments use tasers UC Los Angeles UC San Diego UC Santa Barbara UC 
Irvine UC Riverside UC Davis UC Merced UC San Francisco UC Santa Cruz and UC 
Berkeley currently do not intend to purchase In addition to CSO programs UCPD departments each 
have a Communications Division which is the police dispatch center and the access point for 
each UC campus Each department also staffs a Detective Division to investigate crimes and other 
cases reported by citizens and the patrol officers In addition to these standard police bureaus 
several UCPD departments also staff more specialized police and public safety units These include Emergency 
Medical Services EMS Bomb Squad Crime Prevention Units Special Response Teams Crime labs Dignitary Protection 
Units Negotiation and Entry Teams and others The University of California was founded in shortly 
after California became a state The university moved to the present site in Berkeley in 
with students and faculty members Other campuses were added over time resulting in a system 
which includes ten campuses spread out from San Francisco to San Diego The university also 
manages four national laboratories and is affiliated with the Hastings School of Law in San 
Francisco and the San Francisco Art Institute Now the University of California Berkeley alone has 
about students fulltime faculty members and staff members The original UC Police Department started on 
the Berkeley campus after the First World War The very first security employees were three 
watchmen who wore fulllength street carmen's coats They each carried keys a sidearm and a 
flashlight as well as a switch to chase errant dogs from the Greek Theater stage 
during weekend concerts In Captain Walter J Lee was appointed to lead the department which 
he did for the next thirty plus years Captain Lee is given creditby whom for 
the eventual growth and efficiency of the police department In The regents established the University 
of California Police Department in its own right as a fully constituted police agency with 
authority based on Sections and of the State Education Code By UCB Police consisted of 
about twentytwo sworn personnel whose duties had been generally construed as "Big Brothers" to students 
needing guidance There was a heavy emphasis on personal service and oneonone contact with the 
campus community Panty raids were consideredby whom to be a major student disturbance Captain Lee 
was succeeded by Captain W W Wadman Captain Wadman was the first university staff member 
in the country who was selected to attend the FBI National Academycitation needed Campus police 
duties during his tenure included patrolling the campus enforcing traffic regulations and controlling traffic investigating 
reports and complaints conducting escorts and policing an assortment of events Officers usually walked their 
beats and rarely used cars The only communications between dispatchers and officers in the field 
were staggered hourly callins and at night the use of the light on top of 
the Campanile a regional landmark used to summon officers in emergencies In the state established 
the Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training POST to develop minimum standards and requirements 
for all police officers in the state thus leading to the development of a fully 
professional police force In the fall of the Free Speech Movement began in Berkeley a 
phenomenon which spread to many other college campuses in the following years In December the 
police arrested people in the Sproul Hall Sitin the largest mass arrest undertaken in the 
country up to that time After the Free Speech Movement there were seven years of 
frequent and sometimes violent demonstrations including draft protests strikes bombings of the ROTC building and 
PGE Towers arsons and street battles One of the most notable ongoing protests has been 
about a piece of university property called People's Park People's Park history is long and 
appears to be never ending The University purchased the land in to build dormitories but 
were prevented from building due to protests Since that time all efforts to develop the 
land have continued to be met with resistance from community activists On May William P 
Beall the retired chief of the Berkeley Police Department became the chief at UC Berkeley 
In addition to his duties at Berkeley Chief Beall became the first universitywide coordinator of 
the ninecampus police department system Chief Beall oversaw the instituting and managing uniform systemwide policies 
governing recruiting training personnel and performance standards The nine campus police departments continue to work 
together closely The chiefs meet every three months at one of the campuses Chief Beall 
was succeeded by Chief Derry Bowles Chief Bowles had been the chief of the UC 
Police Department on the Santa Barbara campus Chief Bowles led the department through the early 
a time that included massive sitins and demonstrations surrounding the university's investments in South Africa 
In Victoria L Harrison was selected as chief of police She was the first female 
police chief in the UC System and the first in Alameda County She came to

Saturn Devouring His Son is the name given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco 
Goya According to the traditional interpretation it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus 
in the title Romanized to Saturn who fearing that he would be overthrown by one 
of his ate each one upon their birth The work is one of the Black 
Paintings that Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between and It 
was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo 
del Prado in Madrid In Goya purchased a house on the banks of Manzanares near 
Madrid called Quinta del Sordo Villa of the Deaf Man It was a twostory house 
which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf although the name was 
fitting for Goya too who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in Between 
and when he left the house to move to Bordeaux Goya produced a series of 
works which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house At the 
age of and having survived two lifethreatening illnesses Goya was likely to have been concerned 
with his own mortality and was increasingly embittered by the civil strife occurring in Spain 
Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images in time 
he overpainted them all with the intensely haunting pictures known today as the Black Paintings 
Uncommissioned and never meant for public display these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some 
tense scenes of malevolence and Saturn Devouring His Son a portrait of the titan Saturn 
consuming one of his children was one of six works with which Goya decorated the 
dining room According to Roman myth inspired by the original Greek myth it had been 
foretold that one of the sons of Saturn would overthrow him just as he had 
overthrown his father Caelus To prevent this Saturn ate his children moments after each was 
born His wife Ops eventually hid his third son Jupiter on the island of Crete 
deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place Jupiter eventually supplanted 
his father just as the prophecy had predicted Goya never named the works he produced 
at Quinta del Sordo; the names were assigned by others after his and this painting 
is also known as just Saturn Saturn Devouring One of His Sons Saturn Devouring his 
Children or by the Spanish names Saturno devorando a su hijo or Saturno devorando a 
un hijo Goya depicts Saturn feasting upon one of his sons His child's head and 
part of the left arm have already been consumed The right arm has probably been 
eaten too though it could be folded in front of the body and held in 
place by Saturn's thumbs The titan is on the point of taking another bite from 
the left arm; as he looms from the darkness his mouth gapes and his eyes 
bulge widely The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh the 
red blood of the corpse and the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his 
fingers into the back of the body There is evidence that the picture may have 
originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect but if ever present this addition was 
lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to 
canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct It may even 
have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public Various interpretations of the 
meaning of the picture have been offered the conflict between youth and old age time 
as the devourer of all things the wrath of God and an allegory of the 
situation in Spain where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution There 
have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son Xavier the only of 
his six children to survive to adulthood or with his livein housekeeper and possible mistress 
Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed cannot be determined with certainty If 
Goya made any notes on the picture they have not survived; as he never intended 
the picture for public exhibition he probably had little interest in explaining its significance It 
has been said that the painting is "essential to our understanding of the human condition 
in modern times just as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is essential to understanding the tenor 
of the Goya may have been inspired by Peter Paul Rubens' picture of the same 
name Rubens' painting also held at the Museo del Prado is a brighter more conventional 
treatment of the myth his Saturn exhibits less of the cannibalistic ferocity portrayed in Goya's 
rendition However some critics have suggested that Rubens' portrayal is the more horrific the god 
is portrayed as a calculating remorseless killer who – fearing for his own position of 
power – murders his innocent child Goya's vision on the other hand shows a man driven 
mad by the act of killing his own son Or it could be interpreted as 
a titan driven wild with fear at the idea of usurpation from one of his 
children In addition the body of the son in Goya's picture is that of an 
adult not the helpless baby depicted by Rubens Goya had produced a chalk drawing of 
the same subject in that was closer in tone to Rubens' work it showed a 
Saturn similar in appearance to that of Rubens' daintily biting on the leg of one 
of his sons while he holds another like a leg of chicken with none of 
the gore or madness of the later work Goya scholar Fred Licht has raised doubts 
regarding the traditional title however noting that the classical iconographical attributes associated with Saturn are 
absent from the painting and the body of the smaller figure does not resemble that 
of an The rounded buttocks and wide hips of the headless corpse has also called 
into question the identification of this figure as a Although they were not meant to 
be seen by the public the paintings remain important works in Goya's oeuvre When Goya 
went into selfimposed exile in France in he passed Quinta del Sordo to his grandson 
Mariano After various changes of ownership the house came into the possession of the Belgian 
Baron Emile d'Erlanger in After years on the walls of Quinta del Sordo the murals 
were deteriorating badly and in order to preserve them the new owner of the house 
had them transferred to canvas under the direction of Salvador Martínez Cubells the chief art 
restorer at the Museo del Prado After showing them at the Exposition Universelle of in 
Paris d'Erlanger eventually donated them to the Spanish state The effects of time on the 
murals coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling 
plaster on canvas meant that most of the murals required restoration work and some detail 
may have been lost but in this respect Saturn Devouring His Son appears to have 
fared better than some of the other works In Saturn Devouring His Son became a 
popular Internet meme after photoshopped images of the painting surfaced online The figures depicted in 
the artwork have also been labelled frequently Saturn usually representing something the meme's creator finds

During the Cold War the two opposing forces in Europe were the Warsaw Pact countries 
on the one side and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO countries on the other 
side The Warsaw Pact was seen by the West as having an aggressive force outnumbering 
the NATO forces Soviet domination of the Warsaw Pact led to effective standardization on a 
few tank designs In comparison NATO adopted a defensive posture The major contributing nations France 
Germany the USA and the UK developed their own tank designs with little in common 
while the smaller nations of NATO purchased or adapted these designs After World War II 
tank development continued largely as it had been because of the Cold War Tanks would 
not only continue to be produced in huge numbers but the technology advanced dramatically as 
well Tanks became larger and their armour became thicker and much more effective Aspects of 
gun technology changed significantly as well with advances in shell design and terminal effectiveness However 
most contemporary tanks in service still have manually breechloaded guns a trait of the earliest 
tanks which is shared with most selfpropelled and field guns Many of the changes in 
tank design have been refinements to targeting and ranging fire control gun stabilisation communications and 
crew comfort Armour has evolved to keep pace with improvements in weaponry and guns have 
grown bigger But there have been no fundamental changes After World War II tank design 
budgets were cut and engineering staff was often scattered Many war plannerswho believed that with 
the advent of nuclear weapons the tank was obsolete given that a tactical nuclear weapon 
could destroy any brigade or regiment whether it was armoured or not The Korean War 
proved that tanks were still useful on the battlefield given the hesitation of the great 
powers to use nuclear weapons In the many nations' tanks were equipped with NBC protection 
allowing mechanized units to defend against nuclear biological and chemical weapons or to conduct breakthroughs 
by exploiting battlefield nuclear strikes Medium tanks gradually evolved into the new concept of the 
main battle tank This transition happened gradually in the as it was realized that medium 
tanks could carry guns such as the US gun Soviet tank gun and especially the 
British gun that could penetrate any practical level of armour at long range The World 
War II concept of heavy tanks armed with the most powerful guns and heaviest armour became 
obsolete since they were just as vulnerable as other vehicles to the new medium tankscitation 
needed Likewise World War II had shown that lightly armed lightly armoured tanks were of little 
value in most roles Even reconnaissance vehicles shown a trend towards heavier weight and greater 
firepower during World War II; speed was not a substitute for armor and firepower An increasing 
variety of antitank weapons and the perceived threat of a nuclear war prioritized the need 
for additional armor The additional armour prompted the design of even more powerful The main 
battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the 'Universal tank' 
filling almost all battlefield roles Typical main battle tanks were well armed and highly mobile 
but cheap enough to be built in large numbers The classic main battle tanks of 
the were the British Centurion the Soviet series and the US and series which saw 
continuous updates throughout the Cold war For example the Centurion began life with the highly 
effective gun but was upgraded to pounder and then main armament by with improved fire 
control and new engines The Russian started with a gun but has been upgraded with 
both and guns much improved fire control systems new engines track etc The series evolved 
through to the series The first Soviet main battle tank was the while the first 
American MBT was the These vehicles and their derivatives formed the bulk of the armoured 
forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War; many remain in use 
in the century Light tanks such as the Soviet maintained limited roles such as amphibious 
reconnaissance support of Airborne units and in rapid intervention forces which were not expected to 
face enemy tanks The US Sheridan had similar strengths and weaknesses but could also be 
airdropped either by parachute or LAPES The value of light tanks for scouting has been 
diminished greatly by helicopters although many continued to be fielded Heavy tanks such as the 
continued to be developed and fielded along with medium tanks until the and when the 
development of antitank guided missiles and powerful tank guns rendered them ineffective The combination of 
large HEAT warheads with a long effective range relative to a tank gun and with 
high accuracy meant that heavy tanks could no longer function in the standoff or overwatch 
role; much cheaper antitank guided missiles could fill this role just as well Medium tanks 
were just as vulnerable to the new missiles but could be fielded in greater numbers 
and had higher battlefield mobility After the Yom Kippur War of when Israeli tanks were 
destroyed in large quantities by manportable wire guided missiles ATGMs fired by Egyptian infantry concerns 
were raised on the vulnerability of tanks on the battlefield to antitank weapons Subsequent analysis 
showed that Israeli forces had underestimated their opponents during the first phases of the war; 
their alltank tactics ignored the newfound ability of Infantry armed with cheap AT weapons to 
stop tanks Tactically there was renewed recognition for the need for combinedarms tactics This led 
to greater mechanization of Infantry and advanced artillery tactics and warheads Tanks alone were vulnerable 
to Infantry but a combined team of tanks mechanized Infantry and mechanized artillery could still 
win in the new environment In the United States initiated a programme to modernise its 
existing tank fleet and start real mass production of the and later the at the 
same time the was developed Budgets for tank design and production picked up during the 
administration of president Ronald Reagan following tensions between the United States and the Soviet Unioncitation 
needed In response to infantryportable and vehiclemounted ATGMS ever more capable vehicle armour were developed 
Spaced armour composite explosive reactive armour and active protection systems—like the Russian Shtora Drozd and 
Arena—were added to old and new tanks Despite these improvements the larger missiles remained highly 
effective against tanks During the latter half of the century some tanks were armed with 
ATGMs AntiTank Guided Missiles which could be launched through a smoothbore or in the case 
of "Shillelagh" a rifled main gun barrel with a provision to prevent imparting "spin" to 
the missile In the US the Sheridan and prototype with barrellaunchers used the Shillelagh infraredguided 
missile The was cancelled prior to production due to high cost and superseded by the 
Abrams which used a conventional gun The and the were widely considered disappointing due to 
problems of overall complexity sensitive advanced electrical systems some components of which involved the Shillelagh 
guidance system and issues related to the conventional rounds with combustible cases though the Sheridan 
would serve into the before finally being withdrawn The were eventually replaced by using conventional 
guns The Soviet Union put gunlaunched missiles into service in the which continue to be 
used in CIS forces Tanks capable of firing gunlaunched missiles in Russian service include the 
and upgraded Ukraine also employs missilearmed and tanks In the Korean War Chaffees were the 
first US tanks to fight the North Korean The Chaffee fared poorly against these much 
betterarmed and armored medium tanks Chaffees were more successful later in the war in their 
reconnaissance role supported by heavier tanks such as the Sherman Pershing and Patton The heavier 
but older Pershing was deemed unsatisfactory due to its inferior mobility which was unsuitable for 
a medium tank role as it used the same engine that powered the much lighter 
Sherman and the upgraded received a new power plant and a main gun with bore 
evacuator and the Patton designation Less than a thousand were upgraded to standard On August 
the first Pattons landed in South Korea The tank proved superior to the much lighter 
North Korean which were encountered in relatively small numbers By the end of Pattons had 
been fielded forming about of US tank strength in Korea; the balance of tanks shipped 
to Korea during included Shermans Pershings and Chaffee light Subsequent shipments of and Pattons allowed 
all remaining Pershings to be withdrawn during and most Sherman equipped units were also By 
the Chaffees were completely replaced by the Walker Bulldog which was rushed to the battlefield 
by the US Army The Walker Bulldog saw limited combat during the Korean War but 
the conflict served as a testing ground to work out the deficiencies especially with its 
rangefinder British Centurion tanks assisted by Cromwells in the reconnaissance role arrived in Korea in 
late The UK tanks had to operate in much coldercitation needed conditions than their usual 
deployments on the North German Plain The Centurions covered the retreat at the battle of 
the Imjin River with the tanks from C Squadron Hussars under the command of Major 
Henry Huth and by Squadron Royal Engineers The British position on the Imjin river "was 
deemed safe" but vulnerable in case of an attack which prove to be and the 
tanks were able stand their ground in the battle The Centurions were also in Operation 
Commando and were used to capture high ground earning praise from the commander of I 
Corps Thereafter the war was largely static and the Centurions were used as artillery against 
the infantry attacks which generally happened at The Patton was intended to replace the Patton 
and Sherman tanks It had a gun and a crew of Despite it being the 
primary tank of the US it never saw combat while in US service In early 
the US initiated the design of the Patton designated the with a The featured a 
new turret new redesigned hull and an improved suspension The hull machine gunner position was 
removed reducing the crew to On April the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes OTCM standardized the 
last of the Patton series tanks as the Patton Nearly were built from to The 
early designs up to the were powered by a gasoline engine which was coupled with 
an auxiliary engine The gas engines gave the tank a short operating range and were 
prone to catching fire when hit; this version was considered unreliable The heavy tank was 
manufactured at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant and the first units were accepted in The 
was designed to counter Soviet heavy tanks Its longranged cannon was designed to hit enemy 
tanks at extreme distances although it was never used in combat Of the built most 
went to the The tank was relatively underpowered and the drive systems were fragile The 
turret of the was larger than that of the or the to make room for 
the huge gun and the two loaders assigned to it in addition to the gunner 
and the commander The driver sat in the hull The gun was capable of elevation 
from to degrees The British introduced their Heavy Gun Tank Conqueror with the same gun 
as the into service in It stayed in service until the upgrading of Centurion tank 
to the gun having removed its purpose While the US Army deactivated its heavy armor 
units with the reception of the new series main battle tanks in the remaining stayed 
within the US Marine Corps inventory until they began receiving the series MBT With the 
disappearance of the heavy tank from US forces came the full acceptance of the main 
battle tank in for the US Army and later for the US Marine The British 
successor to Centurion was Chieftain in Chieftain was heavily armoured and had a gun following 
a doctrine of long range fire and survivability that would be needed against the more 
numerous Warsaw Pact tanks in the event of an invasion of West Germany Tanks for 
the most part saw limited action in Vietnam compare to the heavy fighting in Korea 
but even in the Vietnam jungle the Patton saw tanktotank duels On March the Special 
Forces camp at Ben Het was attacked by the NVA Armored Regiment The was tasked 
with the mission of destroying the camp's selfpropelled One of the had detonated a land 
mine which not only alerted the camp but also lit up the other attacking the 
firebase Flares had been sent up thus exposing adversary tanks but sighting in on muzzle 
flashes one scored a direct hit on the turret of a killing two Patton crewmen 
and wounding two more A second Patton using the same technique destroyed a with their 
second shot At daybreak the battlefield revealed the wreckage of two and one armored personnel 
The saw extensive action during the Vietnam War over Pattons would be deployed with US 
Forces during the The initial landed with the US Marines in Remaining Pattons deployed to 
South Vietnam were in three US Army battalions the Armor near the DMZ the Armor 
in the Central Highlands and the Armor near the Mekong Delta Each battalion consisted of 
approximately fifty seven tanks were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced 
by Sheridan tanks The flamethrower tank nicknamed the Zippo was an variant used in Vietnam 
When US forces commenced redeployment operations many of the Pattons were turned over to the 
Army of the Republic of Vietnam ARVN forces in particular creating the ARVN Tank Regiment; 
which supplemented their Walker Bulldog units During the North Vietnamese Army NVA Easter Offensive in 
tank clashes between NVA and ARVN units became commonplace but on April tankers of the 
Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantrytank team which was equipped with the new 
Malyutka NATO designation Sagger wire guided antitank missile During this battle one Patton tank and 
one Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle ACAV were destroyed becoming the first losses to the Sagger 
missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the 
Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in In the the upgrade was developed to 
allow the vehicle to carry the heavier gun This was designed to bring the up 
to speed with the tanks then in regular use Most of the were placed into 
service with reserve units by this time By the the were phased out The performed 
in Vietnam in the infantrysupport role However there were few actual tank versus tank battles 
The provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms mines and rocketpropelled grenades The 
plans were laid in the US in the late fifties for a tank with a 
main gun and a redesigned hull offering better armor protection The resulting largely resembled the 
it was based on but has significant differences The mounted a bore evacuated main gun 
had a hull with a straight front slope whereas the hull was rounded had three 
support rollers per side to the five and had road wheels constructed from aluminum rather 
than steel The hull of the was a single piece steel casting divided into three 
compartments with the driver in front fighting compartment in the middle and engine at the 
The driver looked through three day periscopes one of which could be replaced by a 
night vision Initially the had essentially the same turret shape as the but this was 
subsequently replaced with a distinctive "needlenose" design that minimized frontal crosssection to enemy fire The 
was the last US main battle tank to utilize homogeneous steel armor for protection It 
was also the last to feature either the machine gun or an escape hatch under 
the hull Originally designated the the new vehicle was put into production in reclassified as 
the and entered service in Over all variants were constructed In the was upgraded to 
the This new variant which stayed in production until featured a larger bettershaped turret and 
improvements to the armor protection and shock absorbers The was also equipped with a stabilization 
system for the main gun However the was still not able to fire on the 
move as the system only kept the gun pointed in the same general direction while 
the tank was traveling cross country It did however enable the coaxial machine gun to 
be brought to bear while moving The Sheridan was initiated when the replacement for the 
Walker Bulldog the Light Tank was canceled The need for even lighter weight to make 
the tank transportable presented the design with a particularly difficult problem; guns capable of defeating 
modern tanks at reasonable ranges were so large that they demanded a large vehicle to 
carry them so large that they couldn't be used as a "light" tank The use 
of HEAT rounds instead of conventional penetrating ammunition could address this but HEAT rounds work 
better at larger calibers Gun weight is typically the product of caliber and muzzle velocity 
so in the case of the they sacrificed the muzzle velocity producing the lowvelocity but 
relatively largecaliber HEAT rounds fired by the could defeat any contemporary tank at shorter ranges 
but its low velocity made it difficult to use at longer ranges especially against moving 
targets The large lowvelocity gun was also ideal for infantry support where higher performance antitank 
guns would often fire right through soft targets and their smallcaliber guns left little room 
for explosive filler The Sheridan tank would thus be ideal for both direct fire support 
as well as shortdistance antitank engagements The only niche where the Sheridan was not ideal 
was the medium and longrange antitank engagement The muzzle velocity was so low that a 
HEAT round fired at longer ranges would have to be "lofted" making aiming difficult and 
the flight time would be so long that a moving target would be very difficult 
to hit However it appeared there was a solution to this problem by equipping the 
tank with gunfired antitank missiles For longer range engagements a missile would be fired instead 
of a HEAT round and although its velocity would also be relatively slow the guidance 
system would make a hit highly likely anyway The Sheridan appeared to offer the best 
of both worlds; for infantry support the large calibre gun allowed it to fire fullsized 
artillery rounds and canister shot while also giving it reasonable shortrange antitank performance from the 
same gun The Sheridan had a steel turret and aluminum hull It was powered by 
a large diesel engine The thus had excellent mobility able to run at speeds up 
to which at that time was unheard of for a tracked vehicle Swimming capability was 
provided by a flotation screen Production started on late July and entered service in June 
More than were built between and Total cost of the program was billion The vehicle 
proved to be very noisy and unreliable under combat conditions The armor was thin enough 
that it could be penetrated even by heavy machine gun rounds as well as being 
highly vulnerable to mines Firing the gun would often adversely affect the delicate electronics which 
were at the early stages of transitioning to solid state so the missile and guidance 
system was omitted from vehicles deployed to Vietnam The gun had problems with cracks developing 
near the breech after repeated firing Most field units were modified to help address the 
problem but gun also was criticized for having too much recoil for the vehicle weight 
the second and even third road wheels coming clear off the ground when the main 
gun fired The Sheridan saw extensive action in the Vietnam War being assigned to nearly 
all armored cavalry squadrons in country In armored cavalry units began replacing their Patton tanks 
The battle reports from the troops were sometimes glowing while the reports higher up the 
chain of command were often negative A evaluation of the vehicles found the was employed 
in reconnaissance night patrol and road clearing accumulating road miles and combat missions with a 
ready rate of percent Despite vulnerability to rockets and mines it was judged worth applying 
modifications and equip all cavalry squadrons with the The Sheridan was much appreciated by the 
infantry who were desperate for directfire support which generally served in combination with ACAVs as 
armored cavalry units consisted of both and as part of their TOE Armor units consisted 
solely of tanks minus headquarters company and Mechanized Infantry units consisted solely of In this 
role the real problem with the Sheridan was its limited ammunition load of only rounds 
and missiles though in Vietnam service were not equipped with missiles or their guidance equipment 
increasing the basic load of conventional rounds A common fieldmodification was to mount a large 
steel shield known as an "ACAV set" Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle around the commander's gun 
allowing it to be fired with some level of protection The driver has an unusual 
rotating hatch which has vision blocks when rotated forward Included with the set was an 
extra layer of steel belly armor which was bolted onto the vehicle's bottom although only 
covering from the front to halfway to the end possibly due to weight reasons A 
standard modification made during the was the addition of the "Cereal Bowl" commander's cupola This 
mod came about due to the broken rib effect that occurred when the Sheridan fired 
conventional rounds the recoil would pitch the TC against the armor plating resulting in cracked 
ribs The US Army began to phase out the Sheridan in although at the time 
there was no real replacement Nevertheless the Airborne were able to keep them on until 
The Sheridan was the only airdeployable tank in the inventory and as an elite force 
they had considerably more "pull" than general infantry and armor units who were forced to 
get rid of them Their units were later upgraded to the model including a thermal 
sighting system for the commander and gunner The Sheridan's only air drop in combat occurred 
during Operation Just Cause in Panama in when fourteen were deployed; four were transported by 
Galaxies and ten were dropped by air but two Sheridans were destroyed upon The Sheridans' 
performance received mixed reviews They were lauded by their operators and some commanders as providing 
firepower in needed situations to destroy hard targets However the Sheridans' employment of only HEAT 
rounds limited their effectiveness against reinforced concrete construction Fiftyone Sheridans were deployed in the Gulf 
War as some of the first tanks sent They would not be very effective against 
the Russianbuilt Their role was limited by age and light armor to reconnaissance duties possibly 
or less Shillelagh missiles were at Iraqi bunkers these fewer than a halfdozen missiles were 
the only time that the Shillelagh had been fired in a combat environment from the 
inventory of the aforementioned missiles produced Several attempts to upgun or replace the Sheridan have 
been made but none were successful Several experimental versions of the Sheridan mounting a new 
turret carrying a gun were made but the resulting recoil was too great Several possible 
replacements for the were tested as a part of the Armored Gun System and Expeditionary 
tank efforts of the early and late respectively but none of these entered service The 
Stryker Mobile Gun System has replaced the light tank role of the United States During 
the the US and West Germany entered a joint project for a new tank common 
to both armies and intended to enter service in the The project was technically advanced 
with sophisticated suspension a low silhouette spaced armor and advanced gun systems but suffered from 
excessive costs and the Germans pulled out of the project at the end of the 
decade After Vietnam the Patton was upgraded and designated the It featured an entirely new 
lowprofile turret with a commander's machinegun cupola on top giving the commander a good view 
and field of fire while under armor but spoiling the low profile It also featured 
a cannon which fired conventional rounds as well as guided missiles The proved a disappointment 
though technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks The system was phased out 
from active units by and the turrets scrapped Most of the tanks were rebuilt as 
In work began on the variant It featured a number of technological enhancements including smoke 
dischargers a new rangefinder and ballistic computer and a turret stabilization system In addition it 
reverted to the cannon All active American eventually underwent the conversion to the model The 
was phased out of US service in The German Leopard tank another armed tank was 
introduced in It was sold widely to several nations in NATO as well as worldwide 
It was followed in by the Leopard with a smoothbore gun In prototypes of a 
new tank which became the Abrams were delivered by Chrysler Defense and General Motors armed 
with a rifled cannon The Chrysler Defense design was selected for development as the In 
General Dynamics Land Systems Division purchased Chrysler Defense The Abrams came from the diverted funds 
from the over budget and impractical and projects The was the first of its kind 
It feature a low profile turret and for the first time ever on a tank 
composite Chobham armor Despite all these advances the Abrams still retained the crew of the 
Patton as the autoloader was considered unproven and risky It was armed with the same 
gun as the Over Abrams were produced and first entered US Army service in About 
upgraded Abrams were produced and used the German smoothbore cannon improved armor and a CBRN 
protection system As the Abrams entered service in the they would operate alongside Patton These 
exercises usually took place in Western Europe especially West Germany but also in some other 
countries like South Korea During such training Abrams crews honed their skills for use against 
the Soviet Union However by the USSR had collapsed and the Abrams would have its 
trial by fire in the Middle East The British Challenger continuing with a rifled gun 
for long range accuracy and the use of widest type of rounds and protected by 
Chobham armor entered service in The Gulf War saw the US Marines still deploying obsolete 
Pattons while the rest of the tank forces had Abrams The Iraqi forces were initially 
regular army units equipped with tanks such as tanks and The Coalition main battle tanks 
such as the US Abrams British Challenger and Kuwaiti were vastly superior to the Chinese 
Type and domestically built tanks used by the Iraqis with crews better trained and armoured 
doctrine better developed The majority of Iraqi armored forces still used old Chinese Type and 
Type Sovietmade from the and and some poor quality Asad Babil tanks domestically assembled tank 
based on Polish hulls with other parts of mixed origin These machines were not equipped 
with uptodate equipment such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders and their effectiveness in modern 
combat was very limited The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal 
sights and sabot rounds used by Coalition armour This equipment enabled them to engage and 
destroy Iraqi tanks from more than three times the range that Iraqi tanks could engage 
coalition tanks Some Iraqi crews even fired training rounds at the US and British tanks 
These rounds purchased in great number during the Iran–Iraq War due to their inexpensive cost 
had soft steel penetrators and thus no hope of penetrating the advanced Chobham Armour of 
the Coalition tanks In the Iraqi war in an Iraqi division the Armored Division of 
the Iraqi which was equipped with and defending the control of key bridges over the 
Euphrates River and the Saddam Canal at Nasiriyah were decimated by US Marines with Abrams 
and the division as a unit rendered incapable for combat during the Battle of Nasiriyah 
in March during the invasion In addition to the and tanks that Iraq had the 
most feared to US armoured forces were the tanks in the Iraqi forces Only Republican 
Guard divisions were equipped with Iraqimodified Many of the Iraqi were dugin or hidden in 
groves and then used to ambush the US or British tanks In the war the 
Iraqi were the preferred target for Apache helicopters and in an attempt to diminish the 
combat power of Republican Guard divisions The only chance for the Asad Babil against American 
tanks was to lure them to close range combat or trying to ambush them from 
dugin But even in those conditions the usually prevailed as proven in circumstances like the 
Battle of Baghdad and the drive to the capital where dozens of Iraqi MBTs were 
or near Mahmoudiyah south of Baghdad April Iraqi Freedom when US tanks engaged their counterparts 
from just yards shattering seven enemy without The Lion of Babylon was utterly outclassed by 
the Abrams the Challenger and by any other contemporary Western main battle tank during the

their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place This peaceful period 
was however shattered with the rise of Qara Iskander who reportedly made Armenia a "desert" 
and subjected it to "devastation and plunder to slaughter and Iskander's wars with and eventual 
defeat by the Timurids invited further destruction in Armenia as many Armenians were taken captive

CBS Columbia Square located at Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood Los Angeles California was the home 
of CBS's Los Angeles radio and television operations from until The building housed the CBS 
Radio Network's West Coast facilities as well as CBS's original Los Angeles radio stations KNX 
and KCBSFM KNXTTV Channel now KCBSTV moved into the complex in and the CBS Television 
Network's West Coast operations were based there until it moved to the larger CBS Television 
City in November After its purchase by CBS in KCALTV moved to the Square from 
studios adjacent to CBS's thencorporate sibling Paramount Pictures Between and all of these operations moved 
to other facilities in the Los Angeles area Columbia Square was built for KNX and 
as the Columbia Broadcasting System's West Coast operations headquarters on the site of the Nestor 
Film Company Hollywood's first movie studio The Christie Film Company eventually took over operation of 
Nestor Studios and filmed comedies on the site originally the location of an early Hollywood 
roadhouse Prior to moving to Columbia Square KNX had been situated at several Hollywood locations 
Columbia Square was designed by Swissborn architect William in the style of International Modernism and 
built over a year at a cost of two million dollars — more money than 
had ever been spent on a broadcasting facility Lescaze's sweeping streamline motifs porthole windows and 
glass brick were true to Modernist design though CBS President William Paley insisted the Square's 
form follow function In his dedicatory speech he remarked "It is because we believe these 
new Hollywood headquarters reflecting many innovations of design and acoustics and control will improve the 
art of broadcasting that we have built them and are dedicating them here tonight" Columbia 
Square opened April with a full day of special broadcasts culminating in the starstudded evening 
special "A Salute to Columbia Square" featuring Bob Hope Al Jolson and Cecil B DeMille 
Crowds thronged Sunset Boulevard and a blimp bathed in searchlights hovered overhead as the program 
was carried coasttocoast on the Columbia Broadcasting System beamed to Europe via short wave and 
carried across Canada on the CBC On that premiere broadcast Hope joked that Columbia Square 
looked like "the Taj Mahal with a permanent wave" Jolson quipped "It looks like Flash 
Gordon's bathroom" The Square's original configuration included eight studios Studios through were to the left 
of the main entrance Upstairs were Studios through and at the rear of the forecourt 
was the large auditorium referred to as the "Columbia Playhouse" that seated In two new 
audience theatres were added to the east of the auditorium called "Studio B" and "Studio 
C" each seating approximately people Shows such as Jack Benny's Lucky Strike Program and The 
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet originated from Studio B Lucille Ball's My Favorite Husband Blondie 
and Dr Christian are a few of the shows that broadcast from Studio C When 
B and C were built the Columbia Playhouse then took the letter designation of "Studio 
A" Studio A was home to The Silver Theatre The Swan Show starring George Burns 
and Gracie Allen The Lady Esther Screen Guild Players and countless others The complex included 
Brittingham's Radio Center Restaurant a men's clothing store and a branch of the Bank of 
America Tours of the studios cost cents and passed by a glasswindowed control room housing 
Columbia's West Coast master control "Columbia Square was one of the glories of radio It 
was somewhat sacred to those in the industry There was nothing comparable to its splendor 
in New York" says writerproducer Norman Corwin whose most famous broadcast On a Note of 
Triumph originated from the Square on VE Day In early the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage 
Commission and the City Council designated CBS Columbia Square Studios as a historiccultural monument Columbia 
Square became home to some of the bestknown comedies of radio's golden age Jack Benny 
Burns and Allen Edgar Bergen Red Skelton Eve Arden Our Miss Brooks Jack Oakie and

of Brave New World and Columbia Presents Corwin — dramas produced by Norman Corwin Musical 
acts that performed at Columbia Square included Eddie Cantor Rosemary Clooney Bing Crosby and Gene 
Autry Composer Bernard Hermann frequently scored and conducted Columbia Square broadcasts Through the facilities of 
KNX the Columbia network broadcast big band music from nearby ballrooms including the Hollywood Palladium 
and the Earl Caroll Theater When The Bing Crosby Show moved to CBS in it 
took over space on the second floor of the east side of Columbia Square A 
tape recording and editing facility also was built there to support the show It was 
first facility of its kind to support a national radio show The recording sessions and 
the audience shows were usually held in the CBS theater at Vine Street just north 
of Hollywood Boulevard With the new three recorder facility the radio show evolved from a 
cut and splice operation into one that was created from many different recording sessions with 
audience reactions incorporated It was new territory explored by the Crosby In the late and 
early Columbia Square also served as a CBS television facility In the first West Coastbased 
variety program The Ed Wynn Show was produced on Stage A Lucille Ball's first national 
TV appearance took place on The Ed Wynn Show in December aired on the East 
Coast just after New Year Within the year Stage A would be the location of 
the shooting of the pilot episode of I Love Lucy In the KNX broadcast A 
Salute to Columbia Square announcer George Walsh recalled crowds jamming the Square's forecourt for tickets 
to live broadcasts Ushers would sometimes walk down Sunset Boulevard to NBC's studios at Vine 
Street to urge audience members to watch a Columbia Square broadcast instead After their onair 
appearances actors would dash to the Radio Actors Telephone Exchange in the Square's lobby to 
check with their agents about their next bookings Bob Crane was a toprated KNX deejay 
at Columbia Square in the and James Dean worked as an usher Some of the 
Square's onceluxurious radio theaters were converted to recording studios for Columbia Records where Bob Dylan 
Barbra Streisand and many other top stars recorded albums KNX moved into new studios in

its Columbia Square studios On April KCBSTV and KCALTV left the building and moved their 
operations to the CBS Studio Center in Studio City thus ending Columbia Square's status as 
a broadcast facility one of a very few remaining in The Square fell into disrepair 
during the years in which Laurence Tisch chaired CBS and asbestos problems were cited as 
a reason to demolish the venue Sungow Corp acquired Columbia Square in for million Las 
Vegasbased developer Molasky Pacific LLC acquired the property in August for million It planned to 
redevelop the complex to continue to attract entertainment industry tenants and is considering options that

The Medical Cadet Corp MCC is a program of the Seventhday Adventist Church Adventist church 
started in the in the United States with the intention of preparing young men of 
draft age for military service in noncombatant roles The training included drill first aid military 
courtesies organization of medical corps defense against chemical warfare principles of anatomy and physiology physical 
exercises and character The program was temporarily suspended at the end of World War II 
It was reactivated in and in the next few years was adapted internationally The program 
was deactivated by the General Conference of Seventhday Adventists General Conference in the early but 
continued independently in a few locations with an emphasis on rescue and disaster response In 
the Medical Cadet Corps a component of the World Service Organization that is under the 
umbrella of the General Conference Department of Adventist Chaplaincy Ministries was reactivated as a worldwide 
program Divisions When the Seventhday Adventist movement was formally organized in during the height of 
the American Civil War military conscription was one of the first major challenges to be 
addressed by the fledgling denomination Even before Adventist beliefs about combatancy generally fell into one 
of three opinion groups pacifists who felt any military service was a violation of God's 
command to not commit murder; militant abolitionists who felt that military service would honor God's 
will in ending slavery; and noncombatants who believed it to be their Christian duty to 
support the government in roles which did not violate the fourth and sixth commandments see 
Ten Commandments This latter position ultimately emerged as the denomination's policy and set precedent for 
future periods of conscription in the United States When conscription became law in March most 
drafted Adventists took advantage of the option to purchase an exemption which cost per person 
This sum was not easy for many to come by and church leaders encouraged all 
members to contribute toward purchasing these exemptions for drafted members In February the conscription law 
was amended to allow conscientious objectors to serve the military in noncombatant roles A short 
time later this provision was revised so that it would apply only to recognized conscientious 
objectors Church leaders quickly moved to acquire this recognition from state governors in Michigan Wisconsin 
Illinois Pennsylvania and finally the Federal Following the Civil War the United States military returned 
to an allvolunteer force The Indian Wars and Spanish–American War did not require large numbers 
of soldiers Adventist denominational history is mostly silent in regard to these conflicts When World 
War I erupted in Europe there was much more cause for concern The Seventhday Adventist 
Church looked at the issue in the Autumn Council of in the General Conference Committee 
for a way in keeping with the church's noncombatant beliefs to allow the young men 
of the church to fulfill their obligations and the medical military service was the direction 
they took However since the Adventist church had grown both inside and outside of the 
United States Members in Europe were divided by political and battle lines sometimes isolating them 
from the rest of the church The war in Europe began so quickly it was 
difficult for the church to form a cohesive policy or to support drafted church members 
In the United States efforts to support drafted church members were more orderly and the 
government continued to make provisions for conscientious objectors However misunderstandings did arise between some Adventists 
draftees who took extreme positions and their company officers who often did not understand or 
respect the position of conscientious objectors It is unknown how many Adventists were actually drafted 
during World War I Charles Longacre who was in charge of church military relations in 
the United States for most of World War I claimed that American Seventhday Adventists were 
courtmartialed during the war and were imprisoned in disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth at the 
end of the war The denomination's initiative to support draftees and the war effort in 
general was multifaceted encouraging church members to support government conservation programs calling for preinduction medical 
training providing camp pastors and planning to set up Servicemen's Rest Homes in Europe The 
short time between the United States' entry into the war and its end meant that 
some of these actions were not implemented and the effectiveness of others is The experience 
of American Adventists during World War I generated several lessons which shaped the church's response 
to the draft during World War II the Korean War and the Vietnam War First 
Adventists working in the Medical Corps United States Army experienced the fewest conflicts regarding the 
keeping of Sabbath and bearing of arms Second preinduction military medical training enhanced the effectiveness 
of Adventists who did serve and reduced the problems they faced Third educating church members 
regarding their obligations to both God and society reduced the extremism which often led to 
Following World War I a number of faculty members in Adventist colleges believed that premilitary 
training and guidance should continue to be given students of draft age At Emmanuel Missionary 
College now Andrews University in Lewis S Williams started a program but when it was 
criticized as being "too militaristic" it was stopped At Walla Walla College now Walla Walla 
University students directed a set of questions to the General Conference regarding whether it was 
better to enlist or be drafted clarification regarding appropriate duties for Sabbath whether it was 
ever okay to bear arms and whether the moral nature of a conflict changed one's 
responsibility for military service The students' questions were discussed by a General Conference committee of 
seven individuals charged with studying noncombatancy However this group could not reach a consensus so 
the questions remained The College Medical Corps was founded by Everett N Dick at Union 
College in as a way to train males for noncombatant medic military service The Medical 
Cadet Corps was founded for students of the College of Medical Evangelists in by Cyril 
B In Dick presented his program to other Adventist educators which led to other college 
adopting the In in Glendale California a new Pathfinder group was founded which also added 
military drills from the With other Adventist colleges following suit by installing similar programs the 
Fall Council of the General Conference Executive Committee in gave it official sanction and centralization 
under the name of Medical Cadet Corps In various places a Women's Cadet Corps also 
The GC appointed Dick as the denominational program and recommended that all Adventist colleges start 
a MCC When the General Conference met for its Autumn Council in shortly after fighting 
broke out in Europe church leaders finally sanctioned the Union College Medical Corps program but 
formally adopted Courville's Medical Cadet Corps name although the program would always focus on preparing 
enlisted soldiers About this time Everett Dick and two other leaders met with officials of 
the US Surgeon General's office to establish a unified curriculum for the MCC Thus started 
a twentyyear relationship between Dick and officers of the Surgeon General's office This relationship resulted 
in a curriculum continuously revised to meet evolving military standards and recognition for Adventist soldiers 
which routinely placed them in the Army's Medical Nearly every Adventist college and secondary school 
in the United States participated in the MCC program Each one chose its own uniform 
but patches were used in common Training manuals also differed from location to location Everett 
Dick on temporary leave from Union College was placed in charge of the central region 
of the country Chris P Sorenson was in charge of the eastern third and Floyd 
G Ashbaugh was in charge of the program west of the Rocky Mountains Each man 
was expected to promote the program in his region and to conduct officer training camps 
which trained leaders for the corps established on Adventist academic campuses and in some places 
churches When this system developed flaws Dick was asked to direct the program nationwide which 
he did until he returned to fulltime work at Union College in Women first received 
training at Atlantic Union College and many academies required training for both men and women 
Summer camps were held in order to facilitate training for men who were not attending 
Adventist academies or colleges With the cessation of World War II many campuses stopped teaching 
the courses Only Union College and Southwestern Junior College now Southwestern Adventist University continued their 
MCC programs without With the end of World War II the program ended The Corps 
was reactivated in in response to the reestablishment of the draft continuing in parallel with 
the draft with its end in in the US In other countries with mandatory military 
service or a draft their similar program still The MCC was officially reactivated in with 
an officer's training camp in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp now Mountain Park near 
Beulah Colorado The MCC program took on a different feel during this decade Uniforms were 
standardized and all officers were required to train at national camps so that every MCC 
unit across the nation operated under the same guidelines and instruction Leadership was centralized under 
Everett Dick who as MCC commander held the rank of colonel and beginning in was 
also associate secretary of the War Service After Everett Dick resigned in Clark Smith who 
had worked with Dick since the MCC's beginning at Union College in became the commander 
Camp Doss continued to be held in the summers through at least However support for 
the MCC in the United States declined after Dick's retirement perhaps more due to the 
US Army's implementation of its own noncombatant training program at Fort Sam Houston Most Adventist 
colleges and academies stopped offering MCC courses by Interest further declined as the war in 
Vietnam grew increasingly unpopular When the draft in the United States ended in the General 
Conference closed the denominationwide program Similarly MCC programs in other countries which were strong while 
the countries were under military dictatorships declined when more democratic governments gained power The MCC 
continued to operate locally in some areas but with an emphasis on disaster response and 
collaboration with Adventist Community Services rather than preinduction military medical In a summer camp training 
program was held at Grand Ledge Michigan on the Michigan Conference camp meeting grounds Named 
for Desmond T Doss the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor this 
camp became an annual event until about Doss himself frequently attended an attraction that helped 
bring more young men to the camp each year From until Everett Dick commanded Camp 
Doss aided by a core group of MCC leaders who gathered at Grand Ledge each 
summer from across the nation The camp also attracted international visitors interested in creating MCC 
programs in their home countries Visitors and inquiries about the camp came from Brazil Cuba 
Dominican Republic Puerto Rico Mexico and South The camp was active throughout the Korean and 
Vietnam wars before the property was sold in I am proud to be one I 
will always act correctly asking the Almighty to continuously guide my steps everywere I go 
I am proud to be a part of this organization I will do everything in 
my power to keep on high our morals and standards I will be loyal to 
those that I serve I will obey the orders and instructions of my superiors —citation 
needed With the reactivation of the MCC its proven success for American Adventists and promotion 
by American missionaries serving internationally interest grew in establishing the MCC in many countries around 
the world During World War II MCC training was initiated independently in a few locations 
but in the General Conference purposefully began promoting the MCC program throughout the world through 
the newly established International Commission for Medical Cadet Service Everett Dick was invited to Canada 
in to assist with creating a training program for officers In and he traveled to 
the Far East to establish and supervise corps He also visited the Caribbean and Lebanon 
In each country where the MCC was adopted relationships were established with the local military 
and the curriculum adapted to the standards of that country The MCC was most popular 
in countries ruled by military governments or under immediate threat of conflict It was not 
popular in Europe and was established with reluctance in Japan —citation needed The Adventist Medical

Abdullah Ghaznavi was an AfghanIndian Muslim scholar and pietist A pupil of Sayyid Nazir he 
was exiled from his native Ghazni Afghanistan on account of his adherence to and propagation 
of Ahli Hadith doctrines and had settled in Amritsar Punjab where he soon began attracting 
his own circle of students and According to political scientist Dietrich Reetz Abdullah Ghaznavi represented 
the ascetic tradition within the leadership of the early Ahli Hadith movement in contrast to 
those who reflected the sect's increasing popularity among the urban Abdullah Ghaznavi was born in 
in the Afghan city of Ghazni He was given the name Muhammad A'zam at birth 
but later changed it to Abdullah After studying with local scholars he moved to Qandahar 
to study under the eminent scholar Allamah Habibullah Qandahari and returned to Ghazni after completing 
his In his youth Ghaznavi was particularly inspired by the teachings of the Indian Muslim 
revivalists Sayyid Ahmad of Raebareli and his companion Shah Ismail of Delhi having read Shah 
Ismail's theological work Taqwīyyat alīmān Strengthening of During this period in Afghanistan Sayyid Ahmad's Ahli 
Hadith followers in neighbouring India were widely often polemically associated with the Arabian Wahhabi movement 
on account of their doctrines and in the context of the Wahhabis' potential for political 
subversion something which led Ghaznavi to become a persona non grata in his native Ghaznavi 
subsequently traveled to Delhi with two companions to study Hadith under the distinguished scholar Sayyid 
Nazir Husain He had not completed his studies however when the Indian Rebellion of broke 
out Ghaznavi left Delhi and returned to Afghanistan during the Having adopted a reformist and 
puritanical orientation he began preaching openly against perceived religious innovations bid'ah and against strict adherence 
taqlid to the prevailing Hanafi school The traditional Afghan scholars issued a fatwa declaring him 
to be a kafir and complained against him to the ruler Amir Dost Mohammad Khan 
who ordered Ghaznavi to be During the next fifteen years Ghaznavi traveled to various places 
throughout northwestern India with his family and pupils facing much hostility on account of his 
teachings wherever he went Within this period he returned to Ghazni three times and was 
expelled each On the last occasion he was beaten and then jailed for two years 
before being Upon his release and final expulsion from Afghanistan Ghaznavi migrated to the Punjab 
and settled in Amritsar When he came to that city however some of its people 
started rumors that he was a Wahhabi and this aroused the suspicion of the local 
British administration He therefore shifted his residence to the nearby village of Khayrdi where he 
taught in peace In Amritsar he eventually established a school the Madrasah AlGhaznawiyah and became 
an influential representative of the Ahli Hadith movement in the As his popularity grew further 
centres of learning were established in Delhi Bhopal and Abdullah Ghaznavi had fifteen daughters and 
twelve sons many of whom continued his reformist Abdullah Ghaznavi was noted among his disciples 
for his zealous devotion to God and remembrance of Him He was said to be 
Mustajab AdDu’a whose prayers are answered meaning that many of his prayers were accepted According 
to one account once while Ghaznavi was busy in the remembrance of God in the 
mosque one could hear the walls of the Mosque repeating lā ilāha illā llāh there 
is no god but ShamsulHaq Azimabadi wrote of him in his Ghayat AlMaqsud He was

Engineering driver Fabio Leimer from a fourth position start James Calado finished second for ART 
Grand Prix and Rapax's Stefano Coletti came in third Coletti won the sprint race that 
took place on the following day Carlin's Felipe Nasr placed second and Mitch Evans of 
Arden International was third Coletti won the first pole position of his career in the 
Series by posing the fastest lap in qualifying and he held the advantage until he 
made a pit stop for the hard compound tyres at the end of lap six 
after being put under pressure by Leimer Coletti retook the lead after all drivers made 
their pit stops but he lost the position to Leimer on lap because of tyre 
degradation Leimer held the first position for the rest of the race to claim his 
first victory in the Series since the Catalunya sprint race and the third of his 
career Stéphane Richelmi began the sprint race from pole position but he lost the lead 
to Coletti at the second corner on the first lap Although he was caught by 
Nasr in the closing laps Coletti kept the lead to clinch the third win of 
his career in the Series The results of the first round of the season meant 
Coletti became the early leader of the Drivers' Championship with points and Leimer's victory in

the season due to hot and unpredictable weather temperatures and the abrasive asphalt surface of 
the track which made tyre management As in the round tyre supplier Pirelli brought two 
types of tyre to the race two dry compounds soft "options" and hard "primes" The 
soft compound tyres were identified by a yellow stripe on their sidewalls and the hard 
tyres were similarly identified in One practice session lasting half an hour was held on

the highestplaced rookie in Rounding out the top ten were Haryanto René Binder Trummer and 
Leal was the fastest driver not to enter to the top ten; his best lap

Richelmi Conor Daly the Trident duo of Nathanaël Berthon Ceccon Ma Qinghua Daniël de Jong 
Daniel Abt Jolyon Palmer Jake Rosenzweig Pål Varhaug and Kevin After qualifying Berthon and Canamasas 
physically remonstrated about ontrack etiquette as they waited in the weighbridge area for undisclosed All 
of Cecotto's lap times were deleted by the stewards because they deemed he made an 
"unacceptable" reaction and Bird was given a threeplace grid penalty for impeding With five minutes 
left of qualifying Bird delayed Cecotto at turns five and six because he was warming 
his tyres Bird then turned off the racing line to allow Cecotto through as the 
latter drew alongside him leaving turn six Cecotto however retaliated for Bird's earlier impediment by 
swerving to his right going towards the seventh corner This put Bird into the grass 
on the righthand side of the The first race was held over kilometres or minutes 
which ever came first and all drivers were required by regulations to make one pit 
stop The first ten finishers scored points with two given to the competitor who set 
the fastest lap The grid for the second race was determined by the finishing order 
of the first race but the first eight drivers were in reverse order of where 
they finished It was run for kilometres or minutes which ever came first In contrast 
to the prior race drivers were not required to make pit stops The top eight 
finishers earned points towards their respective The feature race began under hot weather conditions at 
Malaysian Standard Time on Leimer made a fast getaway from fourth place to slalom straight 
past Calado and He drew to the outside of Coletti to contest the lead on 
the run to the first corner but lost the Evans ill with food took over 
fourth place as an overtaking manoeuvre from Calado on Nasr at turn four put both 
drivers The first retirement came on the opening lap as the field braked for turn 
nine and Ericsson misjudged his braking point and ran into the rear of Palmer's car 
Ericsson's vehicle stopped in the barrier alongside the Once a rhythm was established it became 
apparent that tyre wear would become a factor as Leimer put Coletti under heavy pressure 
for first place but he withstood all of his It gave Calado Nasr and Evans 
who were duelling over third the opportunity to draw On lap three QuaifeHobbs mistimed an 
overtaking manoeuvre on his teammate de Jong at turn and they both of them retired 
after making contact with each Coletti struggled as his soft compound tyres degrading and he 
made a pit stop for the hard compound tyres as soon as drivers were permitted 
by series officials to do so at the end of lap That allowed Leimer into 
the lead He immediately began setting a series of consecutive fast laps in clear air 
in the hope of providing himself with a small advantage over Coletti after his pit 
stop However Leimer's tactic greatly reduced his pace in comparison to In the meantime Abt 
triggered localised yellow flags on lap ten when he spun off the track and marshals 
were required to extract his Leimer emerged close behind Coletti after he made his pit 
stop on the eleventh The yettopit Bird became the new leader when Leimer made his 
pit stop but his opportunity of claiming a strong result was diminished when he received 
a drivethrough penalty for overtaking under yellow flag Palmer assumed first place on lap twelve 
and kept the position until his lap pit stop to have the soft compound tyres 
installed on his On lap Evans and Richelmi ran wide at turn one and Bird 
overtook them for Leal overtook Cecotto for fifth on the next Coletti retook the first 
position but started to struggle on his hard compound tyres which allowed Leimer to close 
up as his tyres degraded and had frequent wheel lockups However Leimer could not immediately 
overtake Coletti because he lacked the straightline speed on the straight linking turns and Leimer's 
awareness of Calado getting closer grew more as the race progressed and he knew he 
had to get ahead of Coletti as soon as possible He tried doing this leaving 
the final corner on lap but was unsuccessful despite getting a better exit than On 
the next lap Coletti put Leimer onto the outside line of the circuit but he 
was overtaken on the racing line by Leimer at the exit of turn four for 
the lead By this point Calado got close to Coletti and outbraked him at the 
final corner in his attempt at passing but ran deep Coletti got back through but 
Calado then tucked into his slipstream and had the grip to overtake him around the 
inside at the first corner for second Further down the order Haryanto hit Varhaug while 
battling for position and Dillmann swerved to avoid getting involved in the duel Evans locked 
his tyres and this enabled Trummer to get ahead of him and take over ninth 
Upfront Leimer set a series of lap times under the one minute and seconds range 
in clear air to enlarge his advantage over Calado to two Leimer crossed the startfinish 
line at the end of lap to claim his third victory in the Series and 
his first since the Catalunya sprint Calado was second and Coletti completed the podium in 
third Off the podium Nasr took fourth Leal had the best result of his career 
in the Series at the time in fifth Palmer finished sixth and Bird recovered from 
his penalty to claim Richelmi finished eighth and took the pole position for the sprint 
Completing the top ten were Trummer and Evans The rest of the classified finishers were 
Binder Cecotto Daly Dillmann Varhaug Giovesi Ceccon Rosenzweig Canamasas Haryanto and After the race the 
stewards deemed QuaifeHobbs responsible for the clash with his teammate de Jong on lap three 
and he was issued a fiveplace grid penalty for the sprint The second race began 
under cloudy weather conditions at local time on Ma was ruled unfit to compete because 
the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile medical doctor diagnosed him with gastroenteritis which led to extreme 
At the start of the formation lap Palmer stalled his car and was required to 
start from the pit As a result Nasr used the vacant spot left by his 
teammate Palmer to get ahead of the slowstarting Bird and Leal on the inside line 
going into the first turn However it was the sixthplaced Coletti who took the lead 
away from Richelmi because he made a strong getaway and steered onto the outside line 
to pass him leaving the second Going into the braking zone for turn four Calado 
got caught out by Leimer and mistimed an overtaking manoeuvre on him and hit the 
rightrear corner of his The impact dislodged Calado's front wing and it folded under his 
This rendered Calado unable to steer and had limited braking capabilities since he could not 
control his vehicle which launched over the grass on the inside of the circuit He 
ploughed into Leal and Bird at high speed and all three drivers instantly retired in 
the turn four gravel Richelmi was overtaken by Nasr at turn one at the start 
of the second lap and made it stick at the turn two switchback The top 
three of Coletti Nasr and Richelmi pulled out a onesecond advantage over Evans in fourth 
place with Cecotto in fifth and sixthplaced Leimer who continued to circulate the track despite 
his incident with Calado on the first From then on Coletti opened his lead over 
Nasr to two and a half seconds after setting a series of fastest laps However 
he put himself a risk of putting his tyres under too much stress and creating 
an identical situation of him losing the chance of victory to a driver who better 
conserved his With the lead now stabilised attention focused on Palmer further down the order 
as he moved his way through the field and got to midway through the race 
while Ericsson gained two places to be in On lap Richelmi outbraked himself and ran 
deep onto the runoff area at the turn Evans had conserved his tyres in the 
laps beforehand and overtook Richelmi for He then repelled a counterattack from Richelmi entering the 
first On lap Leimer found the damage to his car from the first lap incident 
with Calado caused too much rear tyre wear and a sudden loss of grip put 
him into a gravel trap at turn eleven and dropped out of the top Tyre 
degradation became a factor in the final laps as Nasr lowered Coletti's lead to seconds 
and later to sixtenths of a second by the start of the final It was 
not enough for Nasr to get close enough to challenge Coletti who managed the gap 
and his tyres to clinch the third victory of his career in the Nasr finished 
eighttenths of a second adrift in second and Evans became the youngest driver to claim 
a podium in the Series in Off the podium Richelmi finished fourth and Cecotto benefited

the stewards and he was required to serve it at the next feature race of 
the season at the Bahrain The top three drivers in both races appeared on the 
podium to collect their trophies and in separate press conferences Leimer spoke of his satisfaction 
over winning his first race for almost two years and revealed his goal was to 
win the opening race of the season "I think it was important for me and 
the team that we’re already at the front Everything worked really well today Mentally this 
win is a real boost for me and the team We’ve worked really hard during 
the winter and it’s paid Calado stated his slow start was caused by cold tyres 
and him starting on the circuit's dirty side Nevertheless he congratulated Leimer on his victory 
and said he was still happy with his secondplace Thirdplaced Coletti said he was happy 
with the result despite problems with his tyres "I scored good points The championship is 
long and we have the time to find a solution to make sure the car 
is even better during the race I’m pretty He revealed his tyres began to degrade 
from the fourth lap which prompted him to make an early pit stop for the 
hard compound tyres because he feared losing time and Leimer overtaking After the sprint race 
Coletti stated work put into his car overnight aided his race and emphasised the importance 
about racing in Malaysia's hot weather conditions "It was really hot out there and very 
difficult especially when you have to think about the tyres and concentrate on doing everything 
right because any little mistake can destroy your tyres and the race can be over 
So it’s really not easy in the Nasr said he was happy with his secondplace 
finish and revealed that was his goal for the sprint race before discussing his duel 
with Coletti "What I could see from the car was that Stefano built a gap 
and was safe from there After that I was mainly trying to save my tyres 
as best as I could When it was eight laps to go I started to 
push to try and catch up with him but my rear tyres did not last 
long enough I think that’s something we need to work on but I’m still pleased 
with second place I’ve scored good points for the Thirdplaced Evans said his team adjusted 
his car to improve its balance for the sprint race and stated he did not 
try to get second because of the high level of tyre wear "I was hoping 
maybe Felipe would have caught Stefano and maybe made contact with him but that did 
not happen Laughs I am satisfied with third in my debut I think we’re in 
a good position for the rest of the Since Sepang was the first round of 
the season Coletti became the early leader of the Drivers' Championship with points Leimer's feature 
race victory put him eleven points behind in second and Nasr was a further point 
adrift in third Calado's second place in the feature race meant he placed fourth and 
Richelmi rounded out the top In the Teams' Championship Rapax assumed the lead with points

Magical Battle Arena Japanese マジカルバトルアリーナ Hepburn Majikaru Batoru Arīna is a crossover thirdperson shooter game 
developed by FlySystem in The game features characters from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Cardcaptor Sakura 
Slayers and Mahōjin Guru Guru Magical Battle Arena is primarily an arena thirdperson shooter where 
the players choose a character and try and defeat everyone else The game offers the 
Story VS and Survival modes the Network Play up to four players and the Mission 
Mode where specific requirements are needed in order to succeed in the mission given the 
grade of how well one did Each character has basic attacks both ranged and melee 
a defense power and a sprint In addition to each of these basic skills each 
character has their own special attacks the effects of which differ greatly between characters The 
battlefield where this takes place is in the airspace above a given map Some places 
are naught but open area whereas others may provide cover and obstructions usually in the 
form of tall buildings or geological formations The characters all share a common control scheme 
including frequent use of 'charging' attacks The plot of the Story mode like many fighting 
games is mainly a framing device that serves mostly to explain how such a diverse 
number of characters would all be brought together The basic plot follows though the specifics 
differ depending on which character has been chosen to play through though all tell essentially 
the same story if from different points of view Every millennia in order to maintain 
the cosmic balance of magic amongst the multiverse a tournament is held in order to 
find the greatest most powerful mage The participants in this tournament are all kidnapped from 
their world of origin and transported to a separate dimension All are told they must 
fight and win in order to return home Along the way one competitor the character 
comes across is their friend andor companion They first must fight and when the character 
succeeds in defeating them they join forces Once the character and their companion have faced 
and defeated all the other competitors they face the apparent host of this tournament and 
are told the truth of the fighting In order to maintain the cosmic balance of 
magic among the multiverse the strongest and most powerful mage must be made a teosu 
sacrificed to run the "magical tuning system Kyrios" The last duty of a teosu is 
to select the next one and the tournament was the most effective way of finding 
who would become the next After these characters fight it is decided that they will 
all work together to find an alternate solution to maintain the balance though the plan 
is never clarified New characters released in the Lyrical Pack update to from Vita Yagami

The story cycle around Kae and Sinilau is well known in Polynesian mythology found in 
several places see notes This article describes the Tongan version of which the main source 
is an old poem Ko e folau ʻa Kae – The voyage of Kae published 
in and some other incomplete manuscripts The third player Longopoa in this respect is an 
outsider It starts with Loʻau from Haʻamea one of the many Loʻau known in Tongan 
history Haʻamea may be the place of his lepa in central Tongatapu or it may 
be an alternative name for Samoa Haʻamoa in Tongan He ran a famous navigation school 
on an artificial lake lepa near Loʻau's boat was either a tongiaki an old sailing 
boat of Tongan design or a kalia a better more modern design originating from Fiji 
One day Loʻau got tired of people taunting him all the time about when he 
would go for a real trip So he had his big canoe dragged to the 
sea and told his matāpule chief attendants Kae and Longopoa to accompany him to some 
nearby islands So they went But when they passed Haʻapai Loʻau told them to 'sail 
on past the shore' The same thing happened at Vavaʻu and then Niuatoputapu and then 
Samoa and then Niuafoʻou and then ʻUvea and then No one realised that Loʻau had 
already decided from the beginning to go beyond the horizon and not to return He 
wanted to go to the land of the talking puko trees probably Pulotu The ship 
steered on downwards ie south or west in Tongan navigation sense They came to a 
white sea; they came to a floating pumice sea; they came to a slimy Eventually 
they reached the horizon at the end of the sky There there is a hole 
in the sky and a great whirlpool in the ocean where the waters go in 
when there is an ebb tide in Tonga and the waters come out at flood 
tide There was also a reef with a pandanus tree and a large rock The 
mast of the ship got stuck in the branches of the tree and had to 
be freed This was done with a push and that push caused the ship either 
to disappear in the whirlpool or through the opening in the sky lost in space 
never to be seen again Kae and Longopoa did not await this happening They had 
agreed to desert this foolish trip and they made it back to the reef Kae 
clinging to the tree and Longopoa to the rock When it got dark and the 
flood current came out again Kae suggested Longopoa that they should find a way to 
escape from the island every man for himself He plunged in the sea and swam 
away At midnight he landed on a sandy island; other sources say many days later 
He saw eight dead whales on the shore and hundreds of neiufi fish or according 
to other sources fewer whales and huge man eating sharks luckily also dead It was 
the lair of the kanivatu a giant bird like the roc which was known to 
be a man eater too Kae wisely hid for the night between two of the 
whales The bird returned to its nest in the morning While it was preening its 
feathers Kae emerged and clung to one of its legs or the feathers of its 
breast according to some or of its wing according to some At midday the bird 
flew away over the ocean with his passenger and when Kae saw they were over 
land he let go The place where he landed was on the coral sand beach 
of ʻAkana Aʻana in Samoan the western part of ʻUpolu He was friendlily received by 
the high chief of the area Sinilau who gave him status more than he ever 
had gotten in Tonga but not enough to enter the kava So Kae stayed in 
Samoa for some time But then he was seized by a longing for Tonga to 
tell about all the wonderful things he had seen and he announced to Sinilau that 
he wanted to go Sinilau agreed and presented him with a farewell gift He would 
be allowed to ride on the back of Sinilau's twin whales Sinilau's had a daughter 
who one day ate a piece of whalemeat which was left over in the house 
She got pregnant and bore a twin who were named Tonga and Tunungatofuaʻa tofuaʻa They 
were whales Sinilau spoke "Go well Kae just tell the whales whereto to go But 
leave them in deep water at the coast And when you have reached your home 
before you go to your relatives prepare a bunch of coconuts scented oil some unpainted 
tapa and a floormat give it to them to return to me" This was a 
very modest request and Kae agreed Kae had the trip of his life Too soon 
he was back at Tongatapu at Poloʻa where the tidal flats start and it was 
just low tide He left the whales in shallow water and sped to Haʻamea He 
told his relatives what had happened and then shouted out to all his friends from 
Fatai and Matafonua and Lakepa and so on that they came with knives and spears 
and axes to slaughter those whales on the beach Tununga was killed cut in pieces 
the meat was distributed to all the chiefs of the different districts and eaten by 
the people of the whole island But Tonga was able to escape A depression in 
the middle of the tidal flats a fishing pool is still visible as a result 
of its struggle to get away Sinilau was extremely displeased about Kae's behaviour when Tonga 
told him what had happened after he had arrived at ʻAkana; with his back full 
of spears and without the promised items Sinilau called all the gods of Samoa to 
a council and ordered them to assemble at both Hunga Haʻapai and Hunga Tonga There 
they would have to cut coconut tree leaves to plait some baskets out of "Then 
tonight go around" Sinilau said "and collect the dung of all the people who partook 
in the meal From Muifonua to ʻEua to Fangaleʻounga to Hihifo to Finally put Kae 
on top of the shit and bring everything back to me" So it was done 
and Kae was brought into Sinilau's boatshed he did not even wake up As dawn 
was approaching a rooster crowed "That stupid rooster" Kae mumbled half asleep "he crows like 
Sinilau's rooster At daylight I shall kill it and eat it" He thought he was 
still at home on Tongatapu But when daylight had come he saw that he was 
there no longer but in a certain boatshed in Samoa And a stern Sinilau with 
a royal turban on his head sat at the entrance Kae had nothing to say 
Sinilau threw him out to the waiting gods who fell on him and ate him 
Although others say that Sinialu threw him in a predug grave noting that Kae was 
not worth more once a commoner always a commoner Meanwhile a big kava bowl was 
brought and all the parts and shit the gods had collected in Tonga was thrown 
in and see after having left it to itself for a while suddenly Tunungatofuaʻa came 
back to life He was only missing one tooth as the Tongans had brought as 
a gift to the Tuʻi Tonga in Muʻa which had made it untouchable even for 
the gods Sinilau suggested that Tununga should not try to smile too much Meanwhile Longopoa 
was left behind on his rock at the end of the world Once Kae had 
left his pandanus tree the other hesitated a while but then finally he swam away 
too He reached a small deserted island where only a puko tree grew But it 
was a magic tree it talked And when Longopoa cried that he was hungry the 
tree instructed him to make and light a ʻumu and then to break off one 
of its branches and to roast it When at the end he opened the oven 
see it was full with roasted pig fowl yams and so forth He ate his 
belly full and slept But next day he cried again he wanted to go back 
home to Tonga The tree then told him that tonight the gods would go fishing 
He should ask them to let him go with them and he would carry their 
bag for them "Make a hole in the basket so that the fish drops out 
and it does not fill too swiftly Because once the basket is full the gods 
will stop But if not they will go on and on fishing And when you 
reach your home island crow like a rooster so the gods will think the night 
is over Now also break off another branch of me and take it with you 
As soon as you come home and while it is still night plant it A 
young puko tree will grow out of it and provide you and your people with 
food as I did yesterday Do not go to see your relatives first because if 
you plant this branch after the day has dawned it will only grow to be 
just an ordinary tree" So the friendly puko tree said and so it happened The 
gods fished and fished and when they reached Samoa they were surprised to hear from 
their new carrier that the basket was not yet full And at Niuatoputapu it was 
still not full Next they reached Tonga Longopoa jumped overboard ran ashore and crowed like 
a rooster The gods made themselves scarce Overjubilant Longopoa directly went to see his family 
Only when the new day had come he remembered the love of the puko tree 
But then it was too late the blessings were spoilt and the puko trees of

Semantic unification in philosophy linguistics and computer science is the process of unifying lexically different 
concept representations that are judged to have the same semantic content ie meaning In business 
processes the conceptual Semantic unification is defined as “the mapping of two expressions onto an 
expression in an exchange format which is equivalent to the given Semantic unification has a 
long history in fields like philosophy and linguistics It has been used in different research 
areas like grammar Semantic unification has since been applied to the fields of business processes 
and workflow management In the earliest Charles Petri at Stanford University introduced the term of 
semantic unification for business models later references could be found and later formalized in Dr 
Bendeck PhD Petri introduced the term “Pragmatic Semantic Unification” to refer to the approaches in 
which the results are tested against a running application using the semantic In this pragmatic 
approach the accuracy of the mapping is not as important as its usability In general 
the Semantic Unification in business processes is the process to find a common unified concept

Summer of is a novel written by Herman Raucher based upon his screenplay and personal 
In TCPalms interview Herman Raucher mentions that the film with the same title gave birth 
to the book Summer of Raucher wrote the screenplay for the film version The movie 
was written first When the film was in postproduction someone told him to write the 
book about Summer of to help publicize the picture So Raucher wrote the book in 
about three or four The book became a bestseller prior to the film's release so 
the film was publicized as "from Herman Raucher's national best Both the film and this 
book are based on the real incidents that happened during the summer of in Raucher's 
life Raucher's novelization of the screenplay with the dedication "To those I love past and 
present" serves more as the tribute to his friend Oscar Seltzer that he had intended 
the film to be with the focus of the book being more on the two 
boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy The book also mentions Seltzer's death which is 
absent from the film adaptation There are differences between the real life incident that happened 
during the night and the incident in the film The book stayed faithful to the 
real incident that happened during that night In TCPalms Raucher pointed out that the real 
Dorothy was drinking heavily when he visited Dorothy during night time This is implied in 
the book But in the film it is only implied that Dorothy "may" have been 
drinking But when Dorothy appears to Hermie in the film visually there is no indication 
of her being drunk at all In the film Dorothy is completely aware of what 
is going on In both the real incident and in the book the song that 
was played on the phonograph record was "That Old Feeling" In the film the composer 
Michel Legrand wrote a new score for the dancing scene The real life incident took 
place in Nantucket Island But the name of the island is not mentioned in the 
film In the book the name of the island was changed to Patchett Island In 
the real incident the real Dorothy kept calling Hermie "Pete" thinking that Hermie was her 
husband while they both were in bed There is no indication in the film that 
Dorothy is imagining Hermie as her husband Pete In the book it is only mentioned 
that Dorothy talked about private things that Hermie was not familiar with Unlike the film 
the book shows that the tears come out of Hermie's eyes while the music "That 
Old Feeling" is playing For the film Raucher admitted about moving the order of certain 
events around and interchanging some dialogue There are several differences between Dorothy in the book 
and Dorothy in the film One of several changes is where Hermie's tongue gets hurt 
by the coffee Both in the film and in the book Dorothy helps Hermie by 
providing ice when Hermie's tongue gets hurt by the hot coffee Unlike Dorothy in the 
book Dorothy in the film repeatedly apologizes to Hermie for the coffee being too hot 
and makes sure that he is doing fine In the film Dorothy moves on to 
her work and also to a conversation "only" after she makes sure that Hermie's tongue 
is feeling better But in the book there is no indication of an apology from 
Dorothy In the book when Hermie was "able" to look up to see what Dorothy 
was doing after getting relief from the ice cubes in the coffee he saw her 
sitting opposite to him and she was already eating one of the doughnuts and she

Ded also Deda or Didák was a prelate in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 
century who served as Bishop of Vác during the reign of Géza II of Hungary 
Ded was elected Bishop of Vác sometime after when his predecessor Hippolytus was last mentioned 
by contemporary The name of Ded appears in a single document without the exact date 
Accordingly Géza II ordered Ded of Vác and Chama of Eger to rededicate the Szentjobb 
Abbey presentday Sâniob in Romania with the consent of Lucas Archbishop of Esztergom Consequently the 
narration occurred sometime between Lucas' ascension to the see of Esztergom and the death of 
Géza The aforementioned document was issued by Géza's son and successor Stephen III of Hungary 
who narrated in his charter that the Benedictine monastery of Szentjobb was attacked and plundered 
by the sons of a certain "Palatine Paul" thereafter As a result Archbishop Lucas excommunicated 
them The charter was later transcribed by both Béla III of Hungary and Charles I 
of Hungary and preserved until the century Its text was published and annotated by Croatian 
historian Baltazar Adam Krčelić in his work Historiarum cathedralis ecclesiae Zagrabiensis partis primae tomus I

Tamás Körmendi questioned the validity of the issuance which suffers from misinterpretations explanations anachronisms and 
factual errors made by plausibly Krčelić thus the authenticity of the original lost royal charter 
is also According to historians István Katona and György Pray Ded still held the dignity 
of Bishop of Vác in but there is no source of The next known bishop

Reed is the CTO The development and management teams include experts in DC power electronics 
and analog semiconductors with global experience in power supplies power management and renewable eIQ Energy's 
primary products are the vBoost and which are DCtoDC converter modules that step up panel 
output voltages and create a parallel connection to a constantvoltage bus With the vBoost converter 
module each panel becomes an independent contributor of power to the array The high voltage 
also enables a bus topology in which panels are connected in parallel rather than in 
series A parallel architecture allows a greater number of panels to be connected on a 
single cable run which can include more than thinfilm panels an increase over conventional seriesstring 
Furthermore eIQ Energy's Parallel Solar architecture eliminates the need for a return line and because 
each vBoost comes with an integrated wiring harness and connector the only onsite wiring needed 
is from the first vBoost to the combiner box and from the combiner box to

Irek Irgiz Russian Ирек Хамидуллин is a citizen of Russia who the United States authorities 
report they captured in Afghanistan in Hamidullah is said to be a nom de guerre 
of a Russian in his fifties who according to some defected from the Soviet Union's 
armed forces occupying Afghanistan in the needed His real name is not known nor how 
he spent the decades between his defection from the Soviet Union and his capture by 
the Americans although the Americans have said they believe he participated in "several" attacks on 
US forces It is known that he was recovering from wounds when captured According to 
a report in the Moskovsky Komsomolets Irek Hamidullin graduated from a Suvorov Military School in 
Kazan and a tank officer training college in Leningrad He left the Soviet Army in 
and became a businessman in Tatarstan's Naberezhnye Chelny selling car parts In he studied at 
a local madrasa named Yoldyz "Star" which was viewed by the local authorities as Wahhabiinfluenced 
He went to Chechnya in but became disappointed with the Chechens as in his view 
they failed to follow the Shariah law After returning to Tatarstan he started looking for 
a place where Shariah is obeyed and later in he went to Afghanistan with a 
group of likeminded Tatar In he was detained in Pakistan accused of illegal crossing of 
the Afghanistan–Pakistan border and spent around half a year in detention After his release he 
flew to Russia on April He was interviewed by Russia's FSB but no charges were 
laid; in the summer of it was reported that he was about to leave for 
The Washington Post reported in December that Hamidullah was one of the several dozen long 
term captives held in the Bagram Theater Internment Facility who were not citizens of The 
Washington Post reported the Hamidullah was considered one of the foreigners with the strongest evidence 
against him and that the Department of Defense wanted to bring him to the United 
States to face charges before a military commission like the controversial Guantanamo military They reported 
the DoD was planning to try to bring less than ten foreign captives from Afghanistan 
to the United States to face charges before a military Quoting officials who would not 
put their name on record the Washington Post reported “He’s pretty wellconnected in the terrorist 
world” and that he had ties to Chechen rebels and two Afghan opposition militias and 
that he had declared he would “return to jihad” if released The US Congress has 
restricted the US President from bringing Guantanamo captives to US territory—even those who had been 
determined not to have been enemy combatants after But Congress didn't consider the possibility that 
captives held outside of Guantanamo might be brought to the US so the restriction does 
not apply to them United States Senators Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham argued instead that 
men like Hamidullah should be sent to Guantanamo Human rights scholars and legal experts questioned 
whether it was appropriate to charge these men before the troubled and largely unprecedented military 
commission system when the United States had successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in the regular 
US civilian justice system Marty Lederman a Professor at Georgetown University writing in Just Security 
in December pointed out that without regard to the speculation over whether he should face 
charges before a Military Commission no one had given any indication as to what crime

Affair at Galaxara Pass November was a US Army victory of Gen Joseph Lane over 
the Mexican Army Light Corps an irregular force under Gen Joaquín Rea The Light Corps 
had been the principal force harassing the US Army line of communications on the National 
Road during Scott's campaign against Mexico City during the Mexican–American War Following Lane's relief of 
the Siege of Puebla he moved against the Light Corps to end that threat After 
their defeat at Atlixco by General Lane a month earlier the Light Corps of Gen 
Joaquín Rea had retreated to Izúcar de Matamoros more distant from the American garrison at 
Puebla and continued harassing the US Army line of communications on the National Road between 
Vera Cruz and Mexico City General Lane decided to strike again at Rea and ordered 
a night march to surprise the garrison at his base at Izúcar de Matamoros Surprise 
complete the Skirmish at Matamoros was extremely successful killing many of the enemy dispersing the 
rest and capturing and destroying tons of arms and material belonging to the Light Early 
on the morning of November General Lane's command moved off on their return march to 
Puebla with or men of Captain Robert's company of Texas mounted riflemen in the advanced 
guard The remainder of the Riflemen followed the artillery and a small train of four 
wagons containing property captured the day before drawn mules and driven by Mexican drivers The 
Louisiana Dragoons were the rear guard As they moved northward though the difficult road through 
the long Galaxara Pass five miles north of Izúcar de Matamoros the train became spread 
out along the road General Lane fell back to get it moving and close up 
the column shortly thereafter a report came that Mexican cavalry had appeared to their front 
General Lane ordered Colonel Hays to the head of the column to engage the enemy 
with the advance guard When the Colonel arrived he found a small party of the 
advance guard being chased back to the American column by two hundred Mexican lancers Hays 
promptly charged the advancing Mexicans with Captain Roberts' company and Lieutenants Ridgely Whipple Waters McDonald 
Blake and General Lane's private secretary Mr Phelps men in all Their charge broke the 
lancers and Hays detachment then pursued the lancers back across the plain and up a 
steep slope toward the mountains from which they had originally come The Mexican Lancers attempted 
to rally but were broken buy the continuing charge by Hays and his men and 
fell back over the summit of the mountain Hays continued in close pursuit where they 
found the defeated lancers being reinforced by the main body of the Light Corps lancers 
under their commander General Joaquin Rea At this point in the contest the revolvers and 
rifles of the mounted riflemen had all been discharged in the advance and none had 
sabres In the face of the disadvantage of numbers and weaponry Hays ordered his force 
to retire to their original position Despite being charged by four or five hundred lancers 
Hays men retired in good order to their original position recharged their weapons and repulsed 
the charge They held their position until the artillery and the Dragoons came up under 
Captain Lewis The artillery was unlimbered When the lancers then retired to the mountains several 
rounds of grape shot and canister persuaded them to disappear from sight During the engagement 
no longer guarded by American soldiers the Mexican drivers cut the mules from the wagons 
and escaped with them The captured property with no means of transport was destroyed with 
the exception of the sabres which were distributed to the mounted men the remainder destroyed 
For several hours after the engagement the Mexican lancers shadowed the march of Lane's command 
They kept their distance too far from the Americans to charge or shoot at despite 
some attempts to do so by the riflemen and artillery The Americans lost men killed 
and slightly wounded all in Hays charge One of the killed was Lieutenant Ridgely Lane's 
acting assistant adjutant general who was mortally wounded while charging with his comrades by the 
side of Colonel Hays The other killed was a Texas Ranger William Malpass who also 
fell in the charge Several men were mentioned in the report for distinction in the 
action among them Private Glanton of the Texan rangers who "attracted general notice for his 
extraordinary activity and daring throughout the actions both of the and The Mexicans loss was 
not accurately known by the Americans but Lane wrote in his report that it could 
not have been less than fifty killed and wounded Of the killed were two captains 
one lieutenant and also three noncommissioned officers of artillery This engagement was a clear illustration 
of the advantage repeating firearms gave mounted troops over those with single shot firearms and 
hand held weapons Lane's column marched on through the night arriving at Atlixco about ten 
o'clock of the morning of the After four hours of sleep the column moved off 
to Puebla where they arrived at two o'clock in the afternoon with no further incidents 
Their raid on Matamoros the subsequent battle in the pass and their return were accomplished 
within sixty hours Lane's raid had effectively negated the danger of the Light Corps to 
the American line of communications for the rest of the war The site of the 
Galaxara Pass battlefield is now partly occupied by the town called La Galarza in the 
USS Delaware was a dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy the lead ship of 
her class She was laid down at Newport News Shipbuilding in November launched in January 
and completed in April The sixth ship to be named for the First State Delaware 
was armed with a main battery of ten guns all on the centerline making her 
the most powerful battleship in the world at the time of her construction She was 
also the first battleship of the US Navy to be capable of steaming at full 
speed for continuous hours without suffering a breakdown Delaware served in the Atlantic Fleet throughout 
her career During World War I she sailed to Great Britain to reinforce the British 
Grand Fleet in the Battle Squadron She saw no action during the war however as 
both the British and Germans had abandoned direct confrontation with each other After the end 
of the war she returned to her peacetime duties of fleet maneuvers midshipmen cruises and 
goodwill visits to foreign ports Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty Delaware was 
retained until the new battleship USS Colorado was completed in at which point she was broken 
up for scrap in accordance with the treaty The two Delawareclass battleships were ordered in 
response to the British battleship HMS Dreadnought the first allbiggun battleship to enter service The previous 
American dreadnoughts the South Carolina class had been designed before the particulars of HMS Dreadnought 
were known The Navy decided that another pair of battleships should be built to counter 
the perceived superiority of Dreadnought over South Carolina and so Rear Admiral Washington L Capps 
prepared a design for a ship with an additional main battery gun turret to match 
Dreadnought's ten guns But unlike Dreadnought all ten of Delaware's guns could fire on the 
broadside At the time of her construction Delaware was the largest and most powerful battleship 
then building in the Delaware was long overall and had a beam of and a 
draft of She displaced long tons as designed and up to long tons at full 
load Her bow had an early example of bulbous She had a crew of officers 
and The ship was powered by twoshaft vertical tripleexpansion engines rated at and fourteen coalfired 
Babcock Wilcox boilers generating a top speed of The ship had a cruising range of 
at a speed of Also because Delaware's engine bearings were equipped with forced lubrication instead 
of a gravityfed system she was the first American battleship capable of steaming at full 
speed for hours without any need for engine The ship was armed with a main 
battery of ten caliber Mark guns in five twin Mark gun turrets on the centerline 
two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward The other three turrets were 
placed aft of the superstructure The secondary battery consisted of caliber Mark guns mounted on 
Mark and Mark pedestal mounts in casemates along the side of the hull As was 
standard for capital ships of the period she carried a pair of torpedo tubes submerged 
in her hull on the Delaware's main armored belt was thick while the armored deck 
was thick The gun turrets had thick faces and the conning tower had thick Delaware 
was built by Newport News Shipbuilding; she was laid down on November and was launched 
on January After completion of the fittingout work the ship was commissioned into the United 
States Navy on April On October she steamed to Wilmington Delaware where she received a 
set of silver service from her namesake state The battleship then returned to Hampton Roads 
on the and remained there until she left to join the First Division of the 
Atlantic Fleet on November She and the rest of the division visited England and France 
and then conducted maneuvers off Cuba in January On January a boiler explosion aboard Delaware 
killed eight men and badly scalded On January the ship carried the remains of Don 
Anibal Cruz the Chilean ambassador to the United States back to Chile She steamed by 
way of Rio de Janeiro Brazil around the tip of South America to Punta Arenas 
Chile She returned to New York City on May and then left for Portsmouth on 
June to participate in the coronation fleet review for King George Throughout the next five 
years Delaware participated in the normal peacetime routine of fleet and squadron maneuvers gunnery drills 
and torpedo practice in the Atlantic Fleet During the summer months she conducted training cruises 
for midshipmen from the Naval Academy She was present in the Naval Review of October 
attended by President William Howard Taft and the Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke 
Meyer In she conducted a goodwill visit to Villefranche France along with the battleships Wyoming 
and Utah She participated in the intervention in Mexico at Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution 
to protect American citizens in the Following the American entrance into World War I on 
April Delaware had recently returned to Hampton Roads from fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea 
There she trained new armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet 
prepared to go to On November she sailed with the rest of Battleship Division bound 
for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea Once in Scapa Flow 
the division joined the Grand Fleet as the Battle Squadron The Battle Squadron was tasked 
with serving as the "fast wing" of the Grand On December Delaware participated in joint 
AngloAmerican maneuvers to practice coordination of the Allied Starting in late the Germans had begun 
to use surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia; this forced the British 
to send squadrons from the Grand Fleet to escort the On February the Battle Squadron 
and eight British destroyers escorted a convoy of merchant ships to Norway While steaming off 
Stavanger on the Delaware was attacked twice by a German Uboat though evasive maneuvers allowed 
Delaware to escape undamaged The squadron was back in Scapa Flow on February; Delaware escorted 
two more such convoys in March and April On April the German High Seas Fleet 
sortied to intercept one of the convoys in the hope of cutting off and destroying 
the escorting battleship Delaware and the rest of the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow on 
April in an attempt to intercept the but the High Seas Fleet had already broken 
off the operation and returned to Starting on June the Battle Squadron and a division 
of British destroyers covered a group of American minelayers as they laid the North Sea 
mine barrage; the work lasted until July King George V inspected the Grand Fleet including 
Delaware at Thereafter Delaware was relieved by the battleship Delaware then sailed across the Atlantic 
arriving in Hampton Roads on Delaware remained at York River until November the day after 
the Armistice with Germany was signed effectively ending World War I She then sailed to 
Boston Navy Yard for an overhaul Delaware rejoined the fleet on March for training maneuvers 
off Cuba She returned to New York with her division on April where additional divisional 
squadron and fleet exercises were conducted She was present for another Naval Review on April 
in Hampton Roads From June to August Delaware conducted a training cruise for midshipmen to 
various ports in the Caribbean along with to Halifax Nova Scotia She went on another 
cruise to Europe from July to August and visited Copenhagen Greenock Cádiz and In the 
years immediately following the end of the war the United States Britain and Japan all 
launched huge naval construction programs All three countries decided that a new naval arms race 
would be illadvised and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations which 
produced the Washington Naval Treaty signed in February Under the terms of Article II of 
the treaty Delaware and her sister North Dakota were to be scrapped as soon as 
the new battleships Colorado and West Virginia then under construction were ready to join the 
On August Delaware accordingly entered dry dock in the Norfolk Navy Yard; her crew was 
transferred to the recently commissioned Colorado and the process of disposal began Delaware was transferred 
to the Boston Navy Yard decommissioned on November and disarmed She was then sold on

Gang Garrison is an opensource indie video game "demake" of Valve's Team Fortress Inspired by 
the graphics of Team Fortress it takes place in a environment while retaining its online 
multiplayer gameplay The game was started by TIGSourcecom users "mrfredman" and "MedO" with other users 
contributing to development It was conceived as an entry into the TIGSourcecom "Bootleg Demake" competition 
Gang Garrison uses the major gameplay tenets of Team Fortress while modifying them for use 
in The player can choose one of nine different classes each with their own strengths 
and weaknesses One is hidden and can be accessed by pressing 'Q' at the class 
select Each class had their name changed and lack abilities as specialized as Team Fortress 
due to technical The classes are Runner Detonator Rocketman Firebug Constructor Rifleman Healer Overweight and 
Infiltrator Additionally the main characters from Cave Story make guest appearances as the hidden Each 
character only possesses one special ability and one weapon; for example the Rifleman's rifle and 
the Infiltrator's revolver There are currently five game modes with a sixth in development Capture 
the flag which involves capturing a briefcase filled with intelligence Control Point where the teams 
fight for control of specific locations Generator mode where each team tries to destroy the 
opposing team's power generator Arena where players try to get rid of the other team's 
players King of the Hill where a single control point needs to be captured and 
defended for a set time and Double King of the Hill where two control points 
are present but both need to be captured in order for the clock to start 
"Critical" shots special attacks which cause extra damage in Team Fortress have been removed in 
Gang Garrison Games are played on online gameservers which the player can find with help 
of a lobby server or join Servers can also be hosted by players Since version 
Gang Garrison has had a "serversent plugins" system in which game plugins which for example 
add voting on the next map or ingame text chat can be automatically downloaded when 
joining a server Development of Gang Garrison began as an entry into the TIGSourcecom "Bootleg 
Demake" competition by mrfredman art MedO programming and Synnah music While it did not win 
the competition it later grew in popularity on the site's forum Initially the game lacked 
several features and balancing especially class abilities for the Constructor and the Infiltrator which caused 
other developers to decompile the code and update the without consent The original development team 
reacted by merging the unofficial changes and releasing the game under an open source license 
to allow contribution to the official version and avoid further Version was released on February 
This version included taunts new music maps and options various graphical improvements a spectator mode 
autobalance kill notification and ingame Version was released on May This version included Control Points 
new music maps various graphical updates Demoman "sticky counter" sentry hud and "superburst" a medic 
ability very similar to Team Fortress "Ubercharge" and various other smaller As of the game 
continues to be developed as an open source project with the source code hosted on 
The game is licensed under the Mozilla Public The game was originally licensed as but 
was relicensed in due to license Gang Garrison received positive reviews from critics Darren Gladstone 
of PC World noted that the game "translates surprisingly well to Tyler Nagata of Games 
Radar commented that it "is guaranteed to make you grin when you hear its cover 
of the theme song with MIDIfied bleeps and bloops and when you start scrolling through 
the game’s super pixilated takes on Scott Sharkey of wrote that the game "was pretty 
much at the top of the heap of demakes" also stating the possibility that he 
might "prefer this thing to Team Fortress and that it was "a great way to 
blow a few minutes while putting off Eric Smith of the Team Fortress development team

Hammerwood Park is a country house in Hammerwood near East Grinstead in East Sussex England 
It is a Grade I listed building One of the first houses in England to 
be built in the Greek Revival architectural style it was built in as the first 
independent work of Benjamin Henry Latrobe It was owned by Led Zeppelin from until The 
land previously comprised part of a previous estate known as The Bower probably named after 
a family called Atte Boure who are listed as paying tax to Edward I in 
the a substantial landholding which included parts of the parishes of East Grinstead and Hartfield 
Sometime during the the owners the Botting family founded an iron forge to the east 
of the ponds in the valley to the south of the current house coordinates The 
forge may have been in existence in when Hugh Botting left "two tons of yron" 
in his will; it was working in but ruined by The dam has been recorded 
as metres In a part of the woodland adjoining the Ashdown Forest was felled to 
clear the grounds of the former house on the present The estate which had once 
been part of a medieval deer later passed to other families and in the owner 
paid window tax on fortyone windows making the Bower the fifth largest out of the 
taxable residences in East Grinstead It seems likely that the present Bower House a Tudor 
farmhouse in the village of Hammerwood is of no direct relation There existed a previous 
building on the site of what was to become Hammerwood Lodge foundations and walls in 
the west of the central block of the current house have been dated to and 
it would seem likely that this was the principal dwelling of the the architect Latrobe 
built the first portico in the year AD and Translated from the Ancient Greek inscription 
situated on the reverse of a Coade Stone abacus block of a column on the 
west In c late or early John Sperling is recorded by Christian Ignatius Latrobe as 
visiting architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe his brother in Sperling who already had a country seat 
at Dynes Hall a country house and acre estate in Great Maplestead Essex came from 
a wealthy family which had made its fortune in the London fur trade after emigrating 
from Sweden – and was only a year older than Latrobe who was at that 
time a pupil of S P Cockerell Nevertheless he commissioned Latrobe to design and build 
a new country house and hunting lodge in the Germanic tradition of the Jagdschloss on 
the site of the Bower Sperling chose to name the new house Hammerwood Lodge at 
this point probably as a romantic reference to the hammer used in the furnace of 
the iron forge which had existed in the area since the Middle Ages Latrobe supervised 
the build from the autumn of onwards its proximity to Ashdown House his second commission 
near Forest Row allowing for the sharing of craftsmen and suppliers of building materials – 
and for Latrobe to supervise both Trinder describes the design as comprising "a large Palladian 
central block corps de logis accentuated by a giant order of shallow pilasters flanked by 
low arcaded wings terminated in tetrastyle porticoes while an asymmetric service wing stretches toward the 
northeast hidden behind the bulk of the Coadeware plaques of scenes derived from the Borghese 
Vase adorn both porticos and the influence of the temples at Paestum which Latrobe may 
have witnessed on during prior visit to Naples and Delos has been noted by In 
due to problems in obtaining payment for another project Latrobe was faced with severe financial 
problems When his wife Lydia Sellon having died in childbirth in November he is thought 
to have suffered a breakdown Declared bankrupt and unable to pay some of his workmen 
he emigrated to America on November There is some doubt over whether Hammerwood was finished 
by this point; it is possible that the Sperlings supervised its completion in Latrobe's However 
the failure of a large investment in a Dublin distillery led the Sperlings to lose 
equivalent to approximately million in pounds; the artist and diarist Joseph Farington reported that they 
and their partners 'overbuilt themselves at a vast expense' Between and Sperling was compelled to 
give up both Hammerwood and his London home and to move back to his Dynes 
Hall In c the Hammerwood estate was purchased by Magens Dorrien Magens a London merchant 
banker who served as a Tory MP for Carmarthen for just six months in he 
was unseated after his opponent lodged a successful election petition and later for Ludgershall in 
Wiltshire from to Upon his death in he left Hammerwood to his son John Dorrien 
Magens who as chairman of the board of the East Grinstead Railway Company EGR was 
responsible for the connection of East Grinstead to the railway system at Three Bridges in 
It would seem likely that extensions to the house specifically to the northeast service wing 
took place under the ownership of the Dorrien Magens family and census records from the 
indicate at least ten indoor staff during the John Dorrien Magens sold Hammerwood to Oswald 
Augustus Smith of Smith's Bank later part of NatWest in June for equating to approximately 
million in pounds of which was for the timber In the Smiths contracted S S 
Teulon with the intention of remodelling the house to their taste Amongst other more subtle 
changes to the building this included raising the attic over the central block to create 
a low third floor whilst preserving Latrobe's façade Work began on May scholars Snadon and 
Fazio comment that "Teulon integrated his additions so carefully with the existing fabric that it 
is difficult at first glance to discern Extract from Oswald Augustus Smith's diary on the 
commissioning of St Stephen's Church Hammerwood March Whilst maintaining the acre estate of parkland arable 
farmland and woods Oswald Augustus also installed a gas system for the lighting of the 
house and fully insulated the newly raised roof Initially paying for a Chapel of Ease 
for the three local parishes of East Grinstead Forest Row and Hartfield in he provided 
for a village school for children; in for the Vicarage; in for St Stephen's Church 
Hammerwood to the design of E P Loftus Brock at the cost of the first 
vicar being Rev Clement Colby Woodland of Corpus Christi College Cambridge; in for the rebuilding 
of St Peter's Church Holtye in memory of his late wife Rose Sophia Vansittart in 
for the rebuilding of the Countess of Thanet's Almshouses on Holtye Common and at the 
end of the century for a new building for the Queen Victoria Hospital in East 
Grinstead Additionally much of the village of Hammerwood which exists today the population of which 
reached a peak of in and some of the houses to the east of the 
village of Ashurst Wood were built during Smith's tenure as tied cottages for estate The 
Rev George Ferris Whidborne purchased Hammerwood from Oswald Augustus shortly before the latter's death Impressed 
by the unusual and abundant wildlife he moved his family from Dorset; the Whidbornes would 
live at Hammerwood from His eldest son was killed in the First World War; all 
three were at different times awarded the MC In the prep school in Tunbridge Wells 
which the Whidborne children had attended burned down; St Andrew's moved to Hammerwood whilst new 
premises were found in Forest Row Old boys remembered playing cricket against Ashdown House by 
now a prep school on the lawn at Hammerwood However in death duties had compelled 
Margaret Whidborne to sell acres of the estate almost half of the land Three years 
later a further acres of farms were sold the house disposed of and the contents 
auctioned Two floors of servants' quarters on the northeast service wing which had been added 
during the century were demolished and left with acres of adjoining park and woodland the 
name of the estate was changed to Hammerwood Park; its place as a focal point 
of local life began to In the remains of the estate – comprising the house 
and acres of land – were taken up by Lt Col Stephen Hungerford Pollen CMG 
after a career in the British Army having been ADC to Lords Lansdowne and Elgin 
respective Viceroys of India winning medals for service in that country and South Africa and 
serving in the Tirah Expedition in His family were the first residents to enjoy an 
electricity supply and water from the mains the heating had by this time been converted 
to an oilfired system There remained a full complement of eleven or twelve – by 
differing accounts – indoor staff for the duration of the Pollens' time at Hammerwood and 
he contributed the land and a quarter of the building costs for the building of 
the Hammerwood and Holtye It is a strange coincidence that one of Lt Col Pollen's 
ancestors Richard Pollen brother of Sir John Pollen Bt married the daughter of S P 
Cockerell the architect under whom Latrobe After the death of Lt Col Pollen in the 
Kirwan Taylor family bought Hammerwood; they were the owners when the Second World War broke 
out Like many large houses it was requisitioned for use by the armed forces becoming 
home to soldiers including the cricketer Denis Compton and a contingent from the Canadian No 
Squadron RAF operated from an airstrip to the north of the park from November and 
the SOE flew Westland Lysanders from the same strip for a After the war John 
Chattell born bought the estate dividing the house into eleven apartments However dry and wet 
rot became increasingly problematic and the house uninhabitable; its listed building description written after a 
visit in November noted that it was already 'empty and boarded up' and placed it 
at Grade II status it was later upgraded to Grade In rock band Led Zeppelin 
bought Hammerwood at auction with the hope of turning it into a music centre recording 
studio and flats Although the house did make an appearance at the beginning of the 
film The Song Remains the Same their plans did not progress Significant vandalism saw three 
tons of lead removed from the roof compromising it in fourteen different places and allowing 
thousands of gallons of water to leak into the structure The progression of the dry 
and wet rot accelerated leading the house to become increasingly structurally The house was subsequently 
boarded up in and put on sale in Having been for sale for four years 
the house was advertised in Country Life in June David Pinnegar a recently graduated physicist 
of years of age purchased the property – by this time in a very poor 
condition and including only c acres of overgrown gardens – in July with the intention 
of restoring and opening it to visitors Although there was some bemusement at his the 
house opened to the public in April and the restoration much of which was undertaken 
by won the Anne de Amodio award from IBI the International Burgen Institute now part 
of Europa Nostra in and a medaille d'agent from the Société d'Encouragement au Progrès in 
Paris in In the house was given a rare copy of the Parthenon Frieze made 
by Brucciani Co which is displayed in the old kitchens now known as the Elgin 
Room The Great Storm of caused damage to the house and gardens with No Squadron 
AAC assisting in the delivery of new roof lead in using a Westland Lynx in 
an operation covered by Blue Peter Except for a small contribution by English Heritage and 
the Department of the Environment private ownership restricted access to heritage grants; the restoration was 
almost entirely funded from visitors costing more than between and making it the largest private 
restoration project in Europe at the time Works continued into the new millennium and a 
programme of rolling restoration is The house and gardens are open to visitors by guided 
tour in the summer and by appointment at other Guided tours focus upon the historical 
context of the house the ancient mythological and religious origins of the Greek Revival connections

served at St Columb's Cathedral Derry for years whilst its predecessor was being repaired after 
the Troubles and is used in particular to promote the music of the French symphonic 
writers such as Vierne and Widor Its expansion from three to five manuals with more 
than stops makes it one of the largest such instruments in Europe with more than 
possible stop combinations The other keyboards are tuned to an unequal temperament such as Well

key in which to write their The estate is also used regularly as a film 
location for TV feature films fashion and photography Films have included the horror movie Knife 
Edge the film London Boulevard starring Colin Farrell and Keira and music videos for Led

as the setting for the narcotics documentary Sacred Weeds Hammerwood has also been used for 
fashion shoots and photography for Prada John Lewis catalogues Tim Walker for Vogue and editorials

to the site of the new house on October Hammerwood is sited on a southfacing 
hill commanding extensive views from the southwest to the southeast; its own southern façade looking

name once sat A serpentine lake artificially dammed from this steam apparently as part of 
the Sperlings' landscaping not shown on a Gardner and Gream map of but visible on 
the OS drawing of sits at the bottom of the valley with open parkland on 
either side; views of distant hills continue for two or three miles beyond Scholars Fazio 
and Snadon note Latrobe's reference to a 'very intimate' acquaintance with Humphry Repton the English 
landscape designer and suggest that many features of the Hammerwood landscape including unobstructed views to 
the south which extend far further than the boundaries of the estate align with Repton's

centuries initially replacing the former sweep of parkland up to the frontage of the house 
shown on maps up to Oswald Augustus Smith who purchased Hammerwood in was probably responsible 
for laying out the ornamental gardens to the east of the house As the cousin 
of Augustus Smith the founder of Tresco Abbey Gardens in the Isles of Scilly where 
rhododendrons feature in the planting he introduced them to Hammerwood and they remain today The 
Smiths also planted the gardens with specimen trees and made up gravel paths through the

is now a registered helicopter landing site Until the century the parkland on the valley 
slopes to the south of the lakes was mainly wooded; it is now under arable 
cultivation for which it was largely cleared of trees in the A few scattered trees 
remain from the extensive pattern shown established on the map of During the period of 
dereliction much of the garden including kitchen gardens and greenhouses to the north became severely 
overgrown and the parkland was used as grazing land with the Library employed as a 
grain Much of the ornamental garden to the south and east has been restored and 
replanted with work done by volunteers from the National Trust Activities Group NTAG and the 
London Wildlife Trust and in the replanting of trees by the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust

by Sperling and Latrobe in the a long winding drive extending from Ashurst Wood which 
approached the house from the south was laid In his study of Hammerwood Trinder suggests 
that from the perspective created by this approach the pilasters on the central block create

mediocre Mindy LaBernz in The Austin Chronicle described the album as "coverfree and since we're 
on the subject genrefree A quartet made five by a trumpet player Cake carry themselves 
with the snittiness of technically proficient lyrically aware music lovers who are almost anachronistically untrendy

French and Nelson leaving the band citing their dislike of "the prospect of extensive national 
touring"; they were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani Fashion Nugget Cake's second album

Motorcade with similarly appealing and Matt Weitz in the Dallas Observer saying that "The gimlet 
eye and sardonic humor of Motorcade of Generosity is intact but Fashion Nugget is aptly

his "droll deadpan  monotone" DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument 
to go with a song he had written; "A lead guitar playing those lines would 
have been really hokey I like it when it's a contrapuntal thing where the guitar 
is doing one melody the vocal is doing another melody and the trumpet plays this

of this reform In Prescott was a candidate in the party leadership election that followed

Blair won the leadership contest with Prescott being elected deputy With the formation of a 
Labour government in Prescott was made Deputy Prime Minister and given a very large portfolio 
as the head of the newly created Department for Environment Transport and the Regions In 
the United Kingdom the title of Deputy Prime Minister is used only occasionally and confers 
no constitutional powers in which it is similar to the century usage of Prime Minister 
The Deputy Prime Minister stands in when the Prime Minister is unavailable most visibly at 
Prime minister's questions and Prescott had attended various Heads of Government meetings on behalf of 
then Prime Minister Tony Since the position of Deputy Prime Minister draws no salary Prescott's 
remuneration was based on his position as Secretary of State for the Environment Transport and

Environment Secretary on developing the Government's postKyoto In October he was presented with the Shechtman 
International Leadership Award at SIPS Sustainable Industrial Processing Summit in Antalya Turkey for his contributions 
to sustainable development in On coming to office Prescott pursued an integrated public transport policy 
On June he said "I will have failed if in five years time there are 
notfar fewer journeys by car It's a tall order but I urge you to hold 
me to However by June car traffic was up by This prompted Friends of the 
Earth's Tony Bosworth to say "By its own test Government transport policy has Prescott had 
success in focusing attention on the role of car usage in the bigger environmental picture 
and the need for effective public transport alternatives if car volume is to be reduced 
The subsequent debate on road pricing evolved from his policy A contrast was highlighted between 
Prescott's transport brief and an incident in when an official chauffeurdriven car was used to 
transport Prescott and his wife yards from their hotel to the venue of the Labour 
Party Conference where Prescott gave a speech on how to encourage the use of public 
transport Prescott explained "Because of the security reasons for one thing and second my wife 
doesn't like to have her hair blown about Have you got another silly Prescott has 
been fined for speeding on four Prescott had a stormy relationship with the privatisation of 
the railway industry He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour 
Party was in opposition and disliked the party's policy established in just before the flotation 
of Railtrack on the London Stock Exchange of committing to renationalise the industry only when 
resources allowed which he saw as meaning that it would never be donecitation needed Reluctantly 
he supported the alternative policy produced by then shadow transport secretary Clare Short that the 
industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the tobecreated Strategic Rail Authority in the 
case of the passenger train operators and the Rail Regulator in the case of the 
monopoly and dominant elements in the industry principally Railtrack The policy was spelled out in 
some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June prospectus for the sale of 
Railtrack shares and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the sharescitation needed 
In Prescott was criticised by Transport Minister John Reid for his statement – at the 
Labour Party conference that year – that the privatised railway was a "national disgrace" despite 
receiving a standing ovation from the Labour Party The companies felt that they had had 
some considerable successes in cutting costs and generating new revenues in the short time since 
their transfer to private sector hands and that the criticisms were premature and In that 
speech Prescott also announced that he would be taking a far tougher line with the 
companies and to that end he would be having a "spring clean" of the This 
meant that the incumbent Director of Passenger Rail Franchising – John O'Brien – and the 
Rail Regulator John Swift QC – both appointed by the previous Conservative government would have 
to make way for new Labour appointees In July Prescott published a transport White Paper 
stating that the rail industry needed an element of stability and certainty if it was 
to plan its activities In February the regulation of the passenger rail operators fell to 
Sir Alastair who Prescott announced would be appointed as chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority 
which would take over from the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising whose office would be 
wound up In July the new Rail Regulator appointed by Prescott was Tom They shared 
Prescott's view that the railway industry needed a considerable shakeup in its institutional operational engineering 
and economic matrix to attract and retain private investment and enable the companies within it 
to become strong competent and Responsible for local government Prescott introduced a new system guiding 
members' conduct after The new system included a nationally agreed Code of Conduct laid down 
by Statutory Instrument which all local authorities were required to adopt; the Code of Conduct 
gives guidance on when councillors have an interest in a matter under discussion and when 
that interest is prejudicial so that the councillor may not speak or vote on the 
matter Although on many areas councillors had previously been expected to withdraw where they had 
declared an interest the new system made the system more formal and introduced specific sanctions 
for breaches; it was criticised for preventing councillors from representing the views of their local 
Prescott supported regional government in England Early in his term he introduced regional assemblies consisting 
of delegates from local authorities and other regional stakeholders to oversee the work of new 
Regional Development Agencies in the regions of England Following Labour's second election victory he pressed 
for the introduction of elected regional assemblies which would have seen about to members elected 
under a similar electoral system to that used for the London Assembly However because of 
opposition the government was forced to hold regional referendums on the change The first three 
were intended to be in the NorthEast NorthWest and Yorkshire and the Humber The NorthEast 
referendum in November was first where support was felt to be strongest but resulted in 
an overwhelming vote of against As a consequence the plan for elected regional assemblies was 
shelved A rising number of households especially in the southeast were putting added pressure on 
housing during Prescott's tenure as the minister responsible An increase in the housebuilding was proposed 
primarily on brownfield sites but also on some undeveloped greenfield areas and as a result 
he was accused of undermining the Green During a radio interview in January Prescott was 
asked about housing development on the green belt; intending to convey that the government would 
enlarge green belt protection Prescott replied "It's a Labour achievement and we mean to build 
on He had not intended to make a joke and was distressed when it prompted 
In the north of England Prescott approved the demolition of some homes that were judged 
to be in "failing areas" as part of his Pathfinder regeneration scheme It has been 
argued that renovating properties rather than demolishing them would have made better financial and community 
Prescott led the campaign to abolish council housing which ran out of steam when tenants 
in Birmingham voted to stay with the council in A previous attempt to privatise all 
the council housing in the London Borough of Camden failed in On December Prescott made

social which he described in Scientific American and other Social spiders challenge theories of social 
biology because spiders are usually cannibalistic and would not be expected to form social groups 
Burgess showed how social spiders modify their environment to be able to live For example 
Mexican spiders called Mallos gregalis spin a web that amplifies the sounds of the flies 
that they eat and dampens the vibrations made by other spiders allowing Mallos spiders to 
live in colonies containing hundreds of thousands of Another spider called Metepeira spinipes spins twopart 
spider webs individual orbs to catch prey and vibrationdamping tangled webs where spiders coexist Burgess 
also described Oecobius civitas spiders who exchange individual webs with each other as part of 
a unique proberretaliator social strategy see evolutionary game Burgess compared the biological forces that produce

Levico Terme Levego in local dialect German Löweneck Cimbrian Leve is a comune municipality in 
Trentino in the northern Italian region TrentinoAlto AdigeSüdtirol located about kilometres southeast of Trento As 
of June it had a population of and an area of square kilometres Levico Terme 
is located on the highest point of the Valsugana valley bottom at metres above sea 
level kilometres from Trento and about kilometres from Padua on the banks of the Rio 
Maggiore brook which is a tributary of Lake Levico from which originates the Brenta River 
The city is dominated by the mountains of the Lagorai range on the north with 
Monte Fronte elevation metres and Monte Panarotta metres and the zone of the Plateaus Vezzena 
Lavarone Luserna Folgaria on the south where Cima Vezzena also locally called Pizzo di Levico 
metres with its distinctive AustroHungarian fort on its top and Cima Pegolara are located To 
the west the Vigolana range can be seen past the lakes of Levico and Caldonazzo 
and on the east the valley opens considerably and the view extends beyond Borgo Valsugana 
The urbanised area is predominantly on the valley floor with the main urban centre lying 
on the left side of the river Brenta along with the frazioni of Selva and 
Campiello while on the right of the river lie the 'frazioni' of Barco Santa Giuliana 
and Quaere Other hamlets do not lie on the valley floor though their population is 
low and often tied to seasonal activities such as tourism Vetriolo Terme metres or mountain 
activities such as logging grazing and recreation Passo Vezzena metres The municipality of Levico Terme 
is traditionally divided into six rioni quarters Chiesa northwest Furo northeast Grande southwest and Cortina 
southeast in the main urban centre Oltrebrenta comprising all the frazioni on the right bank 
of the Brenta Barco Santa Giuliana Quaere and Selva comprising the village of the same 
name and Campiello West of the city above Lake Levico lies Forte Col De Le 
Bene an AustroHungarian fort also known as Forte San Biagio from the name of the 
hill it is built on Traces of inhabitants in the Levico area can be dated 
back to the Iron Age though the first organised settlement springs up during the Roman 
era The etymology of the name "Levico" is still debated The major theories make Levico 
derive from Celtic terms such as leoug leak or lewa signifying "border postboundary marker" or 
from the barbaric gentilic Letta from which came Levi vicus then contracted into Levicus or 
from the Latin praedium Livicune "Livius' farm" then vulgarised into Lievigo and Levigo or Laevus 
vicus "village left of the river" The Latin interpretations are the ones most agreed with 
given the abundance of Latin terms in the topography of the municipality such as Furo 
from forum Successive Lombard presence is also cited in various documents and found in some 
toponyms such as Guizza from wizza communal In the territory of Levico passed under the 
Bishopric of Trent established with Conrad II's donation to Bishop Ulrich II However Levico remained 
under the Diocese of Feltre regarding spiritual authority and would remain that way until The 
name Levico as Levigo appears for the first time in a document dated October in 
a papal bull in which Pope Lucius III reaffirms the rights of the Diocese of 
Feltre in Valsugana Levico followed the history of the Bishopric and as communitas Levigi proclaimed 
its statute in and During the German Peasants' War in August peasants from the Valsugana 
marched towards Trento against the thenBishop's Captain; the rebellion however was rapidly crushed In and 
Levico was ravaged by plague epidemics; the latter cut the population in half In the 
century scientific journals spread news about the health effects of the local waters rich in 
arsenic and iron which were mentioned in Michelangelo Mariani's History of the Council of Trent 
in The first spa building taking advantage of these springs was opened in In through 
a treaty between Austria and the Bishopric of Trent the jurisdiction of Levico passed to 
the House of Habsburg Napoleon I on his way to the battle of Bassano in 
September after reaching Trento passed through the Valsugana encountering a light Austrian resistance in Levico 
which was then defined by Napoleon loco ameno et hospitale quaint and hospitable town Afterwards 
Levico would follow the rest of Trentino in its annexation to Austria after the abolition 
of the Bishopric as a political entity in The Third Italian War of Independence saw 
a battle between Austrian and Italian troops during the latter's advance towards Trento fought in 
town through the night between July and July In Levico was elevated to the rank 
of city Stadtgemeinde by ImperialRoyal Decree under Franz Joseph I of Austria and in it 
was reached by the Valsugana railway At the outbreak of World War I Levico was 
still part of AustriaHungary and as such it supplied a contingent of soldiers The Kaiserjäger 
Regiment had a battalion stationed in the city The civilian population though was mostly deported 
to internment camps Internierungslager in the heartland of the Empire when Italy joined the Entente 
on May The city lay indeed right next to the frontline of the plateaus to 
the south and most of the population ended up in camps in Moravia in the 
socalled wooden cities Those that mostly for being suspected of holding proItalian positions were deemed 
to pose a security risk were instead interned in Katzenau in harsh conditions The peace 
treaty assigned Levico along with the rest of Trentino and South Tyrol to Italy The 
city had been devastated by abandonment and the long absence of workers and reconstruction was 
slow In order to hasten the rebuilding the massive AustroHungarian forts that had been employed 
during the war were scavenged for scrap iron and building material making most of these 
forts little more than World War II touched Levico along with the rest of the 
province only to a limited extent until the Badoglio Proclamation on September when it was 
invaded by the Wehrmacht and incorporated to the Alpenvorland under direct German administration The city 
was chosen as the site of the Deutsches Marinekommando Italien from OctoberNovember to February and 
from July to April as Marineoberkommando Süd despite lying more than kilometres inland from the 
Adriatic Sea Levico was bombed many times throughout the second part of the war; the 
largest bombing on March destroyed the spa building and the Regina hotel at the time

The Firm is a American legal thriller film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Tom 
Cruise Jeanne Tripplehorn Gene Hackman Ed Harris Holly Hunter Hal Holbrook and David Strathairn The 
film is based on the novel The Firm by author John Grisham The Firm was 
one of two films released in that were adapted from a Grisham novel the other 
being The Pelican Brief Mitch McDeere about to graduate from Harvard Law School accepts a 
generous job offer from Bendini Lambert Locke a boutique firm in Memphis Tennessee Mitch and 
his wife Abby move to Memphis and he studies to pass the Tennessee bar exam 
Senior partner Avery Tolar mentors Mitch and introduces him to the firm's professional culture which 
demands strict loyalty confidentiality and a willingness to charge exceptional fees Mitch is seduced by 
the money and perks – including a house new car and his student loans paid 
off – but Abby is suspicious of the firm's interference with employees’ families Mitch passes 
the bar exam and begins working long hours straining his marriage Working closely with Avery 
Mitch learns that most of the firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide money in 
offshore shell corporations and other dubious taxavoidance schemes On a trip to the Cayman Islands 
Mitch hears a client state that the firm's Chicago clients break people's legs Seduced by 
a local woman Mitch cheats on Abby; this encounter was arranged by the firm's security 
chief Bill DeVasher who blackmails Mitch with photos of his tryst to keep him quiet 
about the firm's activities Learning that four of the firm’s associates died mysteriously Mitch hires 
private investigator Eddie Lomax who is shot dead which Lomax’s secretary Tammy witnesses Mitch is 
approached by FBI agents who reveal that BLL's biggest client is the Morolto Mafia family 
from Chicago Most of the firm is complicit in a massive tax fraud and money 
laundering scheme The dead associates had learned the truth and were killed on the firm’s 
orders as was Lomax The FBI warns Mitch that his house car and office are 
probably bugged and pressures him to provide evidence against the firm and the Moroltos Mitch 
agrees to cooperate in return for million and the release of his imprisoned brother Ray 
The FBI releases Ray planning to return him to prison once Mitch hands over the 
incriminating files and gives him half the money Mitch confesses his onenight stand in the 
Caymans to Abby who prepares to leave him When a client complains that he was 
billed for several hours of extra fees Mitch realizes that mailing clients these padded bills 
is mail fraud exposing the firm to RICO charges He secretly copies the firm's billing 
records with help from Tammy but needs files from Avery’s house in the Caymans Avery 
invites Abby to come with him to the Caymans and she declines but he reveals 
his work schedule has changed threatening Mitch's plans Telling Tammy not to inform Mitch Abby 
flies to the Caymans to seduce and drug Avery The firm's phone tap picks up 
Abby's warning to Tammy and DeVasher sends his hitmen to the Caymans After Abby and 
Tammy steal copy and return the files a drowsy Avery warns Abby to leave and 
is later found dead Mitch's plans are jeopardized when a prison guard on the Moroltos' 
payroll alerts DeVasher after Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities Evading 
DeVasher and his thugs Mitch meets with the Moroltos presenting himself as a loyal attorney 
looking out for his clients' interests He claims that his contact with the FBI and 
his copying of files were an attempt to expose the firm's illegal overbilling and asks 
the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices to help the FBI’s case 
against the firm Revealing that he has made his own copies he assures them that 
as long as he is alive any information he knows about their legal affairs is 
safe under attorneyclient privilege Guaranteeing Mitch's safety the Moroltos let him give the FBI the 
evidence it needs to prosecute the firm Since attorneyclient privilege does not apply when a 
lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity Mitch is able to continue his legal career and 
reconciles with Abby The film ends as the McDeeres return to Boston driving the same 
wellused car in which they arrived in Memphis Principal photography took place from November to 
March and though it was primarily filmed in Memphis Tennessee some scenes were filmed in 
Marion Arkansas and the Cayman Islands The film's soundtrack is almost exclusively solo piano by 
Dave Grusin Gene Hackman's name did not appear on the film's release poster Hackman joined 
the film late when it was already well into production because the producers had originally 
wanted to change the gender of the character and cast Meryl Streep until author John 
Grisham objected and Hackman was eventually cast Tom Cruise's deal with Paramount already stated that 
only his name could appear above the title Hackman also wanted his name to appear 
above the credits but when this was refused he asked for his name to be 
removed completely from the Hackman's name does appear in the beginning and end credits This 
is also the final film for Steven Hill and John Beal The film accords with 
the book in most respects but the ending is significantly different Mitch does not end 
up in the Caribbean as in the book; he and Abby simply get into their 
car and drive back to Boston as the ending narration "Do you think the car 
will make itto Boston" A more fundamental difference from the book is the motives and 
manner in which Mitch solves his predicament In the book Mitch acknowledges to himself that 
he is breaking the attorneyclient privilege by copying information and giving it to the FBI 
In most US states this privilege only applies to crimes that have already been committed 
The privilege does not apply if a lawyer knows that his client either is committing 
or will commit a crime However Mitch must disclose information about his legitimate clients as 
well Accepting that he will likely not be allowed to practice law anywhere again he 
swindles million from the Firm along with receiving million of a promised million from the 
FBI for his cooperation After an extended manhunt involving the police the firm's lawyers and 
hired thugs from the Morolto family Mitch escapes with Abby and his brother Ray to 
the Caymans Before fleeing he leaves behind detailed records of the firm's illegal activities as 
well as a recorded deposition Mitch's information gives federal prosecutors enough evidence to indict half 
of the Firm's active lawyers right away as well as several retired partners The documents 
also provide the FBI with circumstantial evidence of the Firm's involvement in money laundering and 
tax fraud and thus probable cause for a search warrant for the firm's building and 
files This additional evidence is enough to smash both the firm and the Morolto family 
with a massive RICO indictment In the film apparently in order to preserve the protagonist's 
personal integrity Mitch exposes a systematic overbilling scheme by the firm thus driving a wedge 
between the Moroltos who in essence become complicit with Mitch and their law firm in 
the book overbilling only received a brief mention He receives a smaller amount of money 
from the FBI which he gives to Ray allowing him to disappear Rather than capitalizing 
on his circumstances by stealing money from the Firm as in the book the movie's 
McDeere ends up battered and bruised but with his integrity and professional ethics intact Mitch 
also makes the FBI have to work in order to bring down the firm by 
having to argue that each instance of excessive billing is a federal offense by virtue 
of the excessive bills being sent through the mail The volume and frequency meet the 
criteria for RICO thereby enabling the FBI to effectively put the Firm out of business 
by seizing its property and equipment and freezing its bank accounts From here the Moroltos 
would then need to find another law firm willing to take them on as clients 
and if they couldn't charges for nonlodgment of tax returns could be brought Since Mitch 
is exposing only illegal activity he is able to retain his law license Instead of 
a BMW Mitch gets a MercedesBenz for joining the firm Avery Tolar was originally Avery 
Tolleson; the latest version of the novel uses the film's surname Tolar is portrayed as 
a sort of reluctant villain in the film while in the novel he has no 
such moral conflicts The surname of the second man killed on Grand Cayman is Joe 
Hodges instead of Hodge as in the novel Mitch's confession to Abby about his sexual 
infidelity was also unique to the film In the novel McDeere never tells Abby about 
his infidelity In the book Abby's not knowing about Mitch's infidelity is a major "suspense" 
piece Mitch comes home one evening and finds an envelope addressed to Abby that has 
"Photos – Do Not Bend" written on it The photos were surreptitiously given to DeVasher 
by Art Germain Mitch thinks it is the pictures he was shown of his infidelity 
overseas Abby is in the bedroom when he sees the open package He enters the 
bedroom and learns that Abby opened the package but it was empty Mitch realizes DeVasher 
is toying with him and this incident in the book causes Mitch to cooperate with 
the FBI In the film Mitch's confession prompts Abby to seriously consider leaving him but 
she ultimately helps him bring down the firm Also in the book Eddie's old secretary 
Tammy seduces and drugs Avery In the movie however it is Abby who seduces Avery 
This also changes the character development because in the movie Abby is portrayed as risking 
herself for Mitch In the book Abby is simply an accomplice to Tammy In the 
novel a dirty FBI agent betrays McDeere to let the firm know about the deal 
In the movie a prison guard alerts the firm to Ray McDeere's release alerting them 
that Mitch McDeere cut a deal with the FBI Critical reaction to The Firm has 
been mostly positive with the film earning a rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on Audiences 
polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to 
F Roger Ebert gave The Firm three stars out of four remarking "The movie is 
virtually an anthology of good small character performances The large gallery of characters makes The 
Firm into a convincing canvas but with a screenplay that developed the story more clearly 
this might have been a superior movie instead of just a good one with some 
fine The film earned some negative reviews as well notably from James Berardinelli who said 
that "very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated 
to the screen and what we're left with instead is an overlylong and pedantic Grisham 
enjoyed the film remarking "I thought Tom Cruise did a good job He played the 
innocent young associate very The film was released while Grisham was at the height of 
his popularity That week Grisham and Michael Crichton evenly divided the top six paperback spots 
on The New York Times Best Seller It opened on June in theatres and landed 
at at the box office grossing million over the of July weekend It remained in 
the spot at the box office for weeks After weeks in theatres the film was 
a huge success making over million domestically and million internationally million Additionally it was the 
largest grossing Rrated movie of and of any film based on a Grisham The film 
earned two Academy Award nominations including Best Supporting Actress for Holly Hunter losing to Anna 
Paquin for The Piano though she did win an Oscar at that year's ceremony for 
Best Actress in the same film as Paquin and Best Original Score for Dave Grusin 
losing to John Williams for Schindler's List The film was released on VHS in December 
the cassettes were specially made of blue plastic The DVD was released on May The 
special features include only the teaser and theatrical trailers The Bluray was released on September 
In April Entertainment One announced that a sequel to The Firm was being produced with 
Sony Pictures Television and Paramount Pictures The series picked up the story of Mitch and 
his family ten years after the events of the novel and film The first season 
was episodes long and began production in Canada in July In May NBC confirmed that

In art history a notname German ˈnoːtˌnaːmə listen "necessityname" or "contingencyname" is an invented name 
given to an artist whose identity has been lost The practice arose from the need 
to give such artists and their typically untitled or generically titled works an acceptable if 
unsatisfactory grouping avoiding confusion when cataloging The phrases provisional name name of convenience and emergency 
names are sometimes used to describe anonymous masters; nonce name was at one time used 
The practice of using generic names for unidentified artists is most common in the study 
of art of the antiquity especially of the Roman era or with artists of the 
Northern Renaissance until about Typically a pseudonym is applied after commonality is established for a 
grouping of works of which a similarity of theme style iconography biblical source or physical 
location can probably be attributed to one individual or workshop but because of lack of 
surviving documentary record the name of that individual is lost Groupings of works under a 
given notname can often be contentious; in specific cases art historians have argued that the 
reality may be a group or school of artists working under a common influence or 
commercial demand Linking a generically titled old master with a historical person is usually a 
tempting and exciting prospect and would establish an art historian's reputation The given notname usually 
depends on the artist's location the most distinctive feature of their work or the theme 
or iconographic element they are best associated with Some notnames created based on a single 
artwork called namepiece Well known examples include the Master of the Embroidered Foliage active c 
to c so named after his distinctive way of painting grass and the Master of 
the Life of the Virgin active c to c and the Master of the Legend 
of the Magdalen active c – c both named after scenes from the Life of 
the Virgin attributed to them the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi active 
c – named after his most famous panel and the Vienna Master of Mary of 
Burgundy c – c named after a manuscript owned by one of his The Berlin 
Painter active c BCE was named by Sir John Beazley for a large lidded amphora 
in the Antikensammlung Berlin the Berlin Painter's In the case of and early Netherlandish French 
and German painters and illuminators the problem is particularly acute and stems from a number 
of factors Primarily the practice of signing and dating works is rarely seen in the 
region until the and the inventories of collectors were uninterested in the artist's Many of 
the unidentified late and early northern artists were of the first rank but because they 
have not been attached to any historical person have suffered from academic neglect It is 
probably a truism to say that as Susie Nash put it "much of what cannot 
be firmly attributed remains less Some art historians believe that this has led to a 
lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons and that such connections often hang 
on thin threads of circumstantial evidence The identities of a number of wellknown artists have 
been founded on the basis of a single signed documented or otherwise attributed work with 
similar works sharing close style or within a geographical range also attached to that name

Charles Dana Tomlin is an author professor and originator of Map Algebra a vocabulary and 
conceptual framework for classifying ways to combine map data to produce new maps Tomlin's teaching 
and research focus on the development and application of geographic information systems GIS He is 
currently a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design and an adjunct professor 
at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies having also taught at the Harvard 
Graduate School of Design and the Ohio State University School of Natural His coursework in 
Landscape Architecture has extensively included GIS and cartographic modeling applications Tomlin’s contributions to GIS extend 
across a number of years and a wide variety of applications As a student at 
Harvard University in the he developed the Tomlin Subsystem of IMGRID as a master’s thesis 
Many analytical functions in IMGRID were later integrated into Imagine a satellite image processing application 
developed by ERDAS As a doctoral student at Yale University in the late and as 
a junior faculty member at Harvard in the early Tomlin developed MAP the Map Analysis 
Package one of the most widely used programs of its kind The open source GRASS 
application derives many of its raster analytical capabilities directly from MAP and was extensively used 
by the US Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies throughout the late Tomlin’s 
work on MAP has also been directly inherited by a long list of other software 
packages including OSUMAP MAP II MapFactory MFWorks MacGIS IDRISI MapBox pMap and MGE In Tomlin 
led an informal group of City and Regional Planning doctoral students at the University of 
Pennsylvania in founding the Cartographic Modeling Laboratory The Cartographic Modeling Lab conducts academic research and 
urban and social policy analysis using GIS and spatial research applications Tomlin has been codirector 
of the lab since Tomlin’s landmark book Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modeling was published 
in to expand on his earlier dissertation work on Map Algebra A significantly revised version 
was released as GIS and Cartographic Modeling in Map Algebra is used for a broad 
array of GIS modeling applications including suitability modeling surface analysis density analysis statistics hydrology landscape 
ecology real estate and geographic prioritization Early in its development Tomlin made the decision to 
openly share all of the source code documentation and algorithms associated with Map Algebra Consequently 
the overall concepts of Map Algebra are still used today in every GIS application that 
supports raster calculations Esri’s Spatial Analyst solution as well as its predecessor the GRID module 
of ArcInfo has incorporated most of the Map Algebra concepts While primarily applied to raster 
data Map Algebra has also been extended to support temporal and other cartographic modeling Tomlin

Sapinsapin is a layered glutinous rice and coconut dessert in Philippine cuisine It is made 
from rice flour coconut milk sugar water flavoring and coloring It is usually sprinkled with 
latik or toasted desiccated coconut flakes sprinkled on top Traditional recipe of sapinsapin calls for 
different flavors mixed in each layer such as ube halaya in the purple layer jackfruit 
in the yellow or orange layer but the white layer has no flavoring The commercial 
version tends to have only food coloring and no added flavoring to reduce the costcitation 
needed Sapin means "layers" while sapinsapin means "layered" in Ybanag and the dessert is recognizable 
for its layers each colored Mix well until it becomes smooth the glutinous rice flour

"Exhalation" is a science fiction short story by American writer Ted Chiang about the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics It was first published in in the anthology Eclipse New Science Fiction 
and Fantasy edited by Jonathan Strahan In the story was included in the collection of 
short stories Exhalation The story is epistolary in nature taking the form of a scientist's 
journal entry The scientist is a member of a race of airdriven mechanical beings The 
race obtains air from swappable lungs filled with pressurized air argon from underground When it 
is realized that a number of clocks simultaneously appear to be running fast but they 
do not appear to be malfunctioning the narrator decides to explore the explanation that people's 
brains are computing slower The scientist dissects their own brain and discovers that it operates 
based on the movement of air through gold leaves The scientist hypothesizes that others' brains 
are computing slower because rising atmospheric pressure causes air to pass through the leaves at 
a slower rate "Exhalation" won the Hugo Award for Best Short The Astronomical Society of 
the Pacific called it a "wonderful while the Science Fiction Encyclopedia described it as and

As Manager Louis Frank Klein October – June was an American professional baseball player manager 
coach and scout During his active career he was an infielder in the Major Leagues 
for the St Louis Cardinals Cleveland Indians and Philadelphia Athletics and was known as one 
of the players who "jumped" to the Mexican League in He was subsequently suspended by 
Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler for a fiveyear span though the suspension was later reduced 
Born in New Orleans he attended Peters High School in that city As a player 
he was listed as tall and pounds and threw and batted righthanded Klein's professional career 
began as a shortstop at age in the Cardinals' farm system He rose from Class 
D the lowest level in all the way to the toplevel Columbus Red Birds in 
and needed only three years of minor league seasoning to reach the big leagues In 
his rookie season in the Majors with the reigning world champion Cardinals Klein was a 
strong contributor to the Redbirds' successful defense of the National League pennant He appeared in 
of the club's official games started games at shortstop and then succeeded Jimmy Brown as 
St Louis' regular second baseman starts when Brown entered World War II military service Klein 
hit a careerhigh and was second on the Cardinals in hits runs scored and triples 
only Stan Musial an eventual Baseball Hall of Famer During the World Series against the 
New York Yankees he started all five games at second base but he collected only 
three hits all singles in at bats and the Cardinals fell to the Yankees four 
games to one Klein then joined the United States Coast Guard serving in Maryland and 
Florida and missed all of and most of the When he returned to the Cardinals 
in September he battled for playing time on a talentloaded team Klein believed his future 
role in St Louis would be limited as a utility player backing up the younger 
Red Schoendienst a future Hall of Famer himself Only two months into the season with 
the Cardinals in first place he jumped to the Mexican League along with teammates Max 
Lanier and Fred Martin Throughout the spring of the Pasquel brothers of the Mexican League 
had been making enticing offers to many lowpaid Major Leaguers perpetually bound to their teams 
by the reserve clause The trio of Cardinals were the latest group to accept In 
an attempt to slow this exodus Chandler banned all players who broke their existing contracts 
to join the Mexican League including Klein from organized baseball for a span of five 
years On June Chandler lifted the bans on the Mexican League jumpers and eleven days 
later Klein returned to the Cardinals Klein's suspensioninterrupted postwar MLB playing career was a far 
cry from his success In games for the Cardinals and more with the Indians and 
Athletics he collected only hits in at bats and played full years in the minor 
leagues in and Altogether he batted in MLB games his hits including doubles triples only 
one after and home runs He had runs batted in Klein became a manager in 
the farm system of the Chicago Cubs in In he began the season as a 
coach for the MLB Cubs for half a season before swapping jobs with San Antonio 
Missions' manager Grady Hatton in midyear Then in he was named to the infamous College 
of Coaches—a brainchild of owner Philip K Wrigley who decided to abolish the position of 
field manager and instead rotate "head coaches" to run the Cubs and their minor league 
affiliates Klein was in charge of the Cubs for games between September and compiled a 
win–loss record as head He'd actually helmed clubs as low as Class D the equivalent 
of a Rookielevel team today during the season In Klein was named head coach again 
replacing El Tappe and managing games between May and June posting a The Cubs finished 
— their first time ever with a season and still the worst in franchise history 
Only the New York Mets were worse In Klein was named to a third stint 
as head coach replacing Bob Kennedy on June and staying on through the rest of 
the season The last head coach in the history of the College of Coaches Klein 
went in and finished with a lifetime record He remained in the Cub organization as 
na na na na na na na na na RNA ribosomal is a protein that 
is the third CubeSat built and operated by students from the Aalborg University in Denmark 
It was launched on February from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in India on a 
PSLV rocket number carries two AIS receivers as the main payload The primary purpose of 
satellite construction at Aalborg University is to give the students engineering experience beyond what is 
normally achieved within a master's degree program The design implementation and manufacturing were carried out 
by students with only two exceptions the manufacturing of the mechanical structure carried out by 
the department workshop in and the raw nonmounted PCBs The purpose of the satellite project 
was to find out if it was possible to receive AIS signals from a CubeSat 
Student satellite activities at Aalborg University AAU started in as a result of AAU's involvement 
in the first pure Danish research satellite Ørsted which was successfully launched in predecessors were 
AAU CubeSat launched and AAUSATII launched Students from AAU also participated in SSETI EXPRESS launched 
a student satellite initiative by ESA Education The construction of began in was launched on 
February on PSLV Operations were a success AIS messages were received on a daily basis 
and downloaded to the mission control center MCC located in Aalborg Denmark All subsystems were 
tested and running The first days of operation were very successful No degradation of the 
satellite was observed all subsystems were working and the primary payload – an AIS receiver 
– was working correctly The mission continued Two critical situations occurred during the first days 
February The last message for some days was received During the previous hours battery voltage 
was decreasing and temperature readings indicated that was steady pointing the side without solar cells 
towards the sun During the last pass over Aalborg it was observed that battery voltage 
was slowly decreasing The situation was discussed and analyzed during the day and it was 
decided to instruct on all upcoming passes to switch off beacon mode because it was 
using power No further attempt was taken to make contact during the weekend in order 
to preserve and recharge the satellite's battery All passes were supervised There was total silence 
until March at where the ground station in Aalborg requestes and received a beacon The 
beacon showed an uptime of day hours that everything was working and that more than 
AIS messages had been received Everything went back to normal The requested beacon also showed 
a high number of reboots possibly due to low battery voltage Due to this event 
was set to tumble slowly – rotations for every orbit – to avoid a repetition 
of the problem May The power system EPS on rejected multiframe communication packages from the 
ground During four passes minutes the students analyzed the situation and inspected the C source 
for the EPS server and a solution was found A new package was sent to 
and normal EPS operation was reestablished During the event the rest of the satellite – 
due to the decentralized design – was working During the first days close to AIS 
packages were received and downloaded June Two new software images for the SDR AIS receiver 
were uploaded It took approximately paths to upload a full AIS receiver image The satellite 
showed improvement and was newly capable of sampling and decoding in real time First metrics 
showed a capacity of around AIS messages per hour on average February One year up 
in space was fully functioning and AIS measurements were done on a regular basis A 
ground station was established at Thule Qaanaaq Greenland for extended download capacity Energy production was 
stable but low so the mission was interleaved with hours or days for charging batteries 
New uploaded algorithms showed reception of approximately messages per hour and realtime performance which meant 
that decoding took less time than sampling and was carried out in parallel Due to 
the ground station at Thule it was possible to carry out realtime supervision measuring and 
downloading at the same time So only a few seconds after detection the information was 
available in Aalborg at the MCC September The last message was received from the satellite 
was based on a decentralized concept with no dedicated master The idea behind this approach 
was to achieve a modular satellite that in many cases would be able to function 
even when certain subsystems failed For that reason the musthave subsystems EPS and COM were 
designed to be simple and robust whereas subsystems like were by necessity more complex with 
a concomitant higher failure rate The power system EPS acts as intelligent supervisor and watchdog 
consists of several subsystems On the ground segment there were All internal and satellitetoground communication

based on a true story and focuses on a female prison inmate who fights for 
women's rights while still in Lynn Schaffer is a loving mother and wife who gets 
arrested for a crime she did not realize she had committed She does not take 
the arrest seriously at first Viewing herself as innocent she goes against the advice of 
her lawyer to take a pleabargain Instead she opts for a trial Coming as a 
complete surprise to her she is convicted receives the maximum sentence of years and is 
and sent to a women's prison leaving behind her husband Larry and daughter Carey In 
prison she has difficulty adjusting to not having any privacy and having to deal with 
drug addicts and prostitutes but soon finds out that the prison is corrupt with Sergeant 
Ed Crang and other prison guards often sexually abusing inmates Lynn is determined to stop 
this but Larry advises her to not interfere pointing out that she could be free 
soon on probation Lynn tries to take his advice knowing that tough Angie and Betsy 
are the only people who are raped However when Frannie one of the few women 
Lynn befriended becomes the third victim she realizes that nobody is safe and decides to 
fight back With the help of her husband who runs a radio station she informs 
the media about the corruption Sergeant Crang determined to keep Lynn silent watches her every 
move prohibits her from receiving visits from her husband and even physically assaults her To 
collect proof Lynn tries to convince fellow inmates to support her but at first no 
one is willing to cooperate because they are either afraid of Crang or Angie who 
forces the girls to remain silent Angie has always been profiting from the corrupt system 
getting drugs from the police and being released on supervision once a week to prostitute 
herself In the end Lynn receives a file from a sympathetic female guard with all 
the evidence she needs When a senator visits to investigate the rape accusations Crang and 
Angie try to keep Lynn from giving the materials to the senator but with the 
help of fellow inmates and the female guard Sheila Lynn is able to reach the

Intrinsic safety IS is a protection technique for safe operation of electrical equipment in hazardous 
areas by limiting the energy electrical and thermal available for ignition In signal and control 
circuits that can operate with low currents and voltages the intrinsic safety approach simplifies circuits 
and reduces installation cost over other protection methods Areas with dangerous concentrations of flammable gases 
or dust are found in applications such as petrochemical refineries and mines As a discipline 
it is an application of inherent safety in instrumentation Highpower circuits such as electric motors 
or lighting cannot use intrinsic safety methods for protection In normal use electrical equipment often 
creates tiny electric arcs internal sparks in switches motor brushes connectors and in other places 
Compact electrical equipment generates heat as well which under some circumstances can become an ignition 
source There are multiple ways to make equipment safe for use in explosivehazardous areas Intrinsic 
safety denoted by "i" in the ATEX and IECEx Explosion Classifications is one of several 
available methods for electrical equipment Others include explosion proof NEC or flameproof enclosures "d" in 
IEC ATEX and NEC increased safety "e" encapsulation "m" enclosedbreak device "nC" sealed device "nC" 
hermeticallysealed device "nC" restrictedbreathing enclosure "nR" oil immersion "o" protection of optical radiation "op" venting 
"p" powder or sand filling "q" special protection "s" and dust ignition protection by enclosure 
"t" For handheld electronics intrinsic safety is the only realistic method that allows a functional 
device to be explosion protected A device termed intrinsically safe is designed to be incapable 
of producing heat or spark sufficient to ignite an explosive atmosphere even if the device 
has experienced deterioration or has been damaged There are several considerations in designing intrinsically safe 
electronics devices reducing or eliminating internal sparking controlling component temperatures and eliminating component spacing that 
would allow dust to short a circuit Elimination of spark potential within components is accomplished 
by limiting the available energy in any given circuit and the system as a whole 
Temperature under certain fault conditions such as an internal short in a semiconductor device becomes 
an issue as the temperature of a component can rise to a level that can 
ignite some explosive gasses even in normal use Safeguards such as current limiting by resistors 
and fuses must be employed to ensure that in no circumstance can a component reach 
a temperature that could cause autoignition of a combustible atmosphere In the highly compact electronic 
devices used today PCBs often have component spacing that create the possibility of an arc 
between components if dust or other particulate matter works into the circuitry thus component spacing 
siting and isolation become important to the design The primary concept behind intrinsic safety is 
the restriction of available electrical and thermal energy in the system so that ignition of 
a hazardous atmosphere explosive gas or dust cannot occur This is achieved by ensuring that 
only low voltages and currents enter the hazardous area and that no significant energy storage 
is possible One of the most common methods for protection is to limit electric current 
by using series resistors using types of resistors that always fail open; and limit the 
voltage with multiple zener diodes In zener barriers dangerous incoming potentials are grounded with galvanic 
isolation barriers there is no direct connection between the safe and hazardousarea circuits by interposing 
a layer of insulation between the two Certification standards for intrinsic safety designs mainly IEC 
but since also IEC TS generally require that the barrier do not exceed approved levels 
of voltage and current with specified damage to limiting components Equipment or instrumentation for use 
in a hazardous area will be designed to operate with low voltage and current and 
will be designed without any large capacitors or inductors that could discharge in a spark 
The instrument will be connected using approved wiring methods back to a control panel in 
a nonhazardous area that contains safety barriers The safety barriers ensure that in normal operation 
and with the application of faults according to the Equipment Protection Level EPL also if 
accidental contact occurs between the instrument circuit and other power sources no more than the 
approved voltage and current enters the hazardous area For example during marine transfer operations when 
flammable products are transferred between the marine terminal and tanker ships or barges twoway radio 
communication needs to be constantly maintained in case the transfer needs to stop for unforeseen 
reasons such as a spill The United States Coast Guard requires that the two way 
radio must be certified as intrinsically safe Another example is intrinsically safe or explosionproof mobile 
phones used in explosive atmospheres such as refineries Intrinsically safe mobile phones must meet special 
battery design criteria in order to achieve UL ATEX directive or IECEx certification for use 
in explosive atmospheres Only properly designed batteryoperated selfcontained devices can be intrinsically safe by themselves 
Other field devices and wiring are intrinsically safe only when employed in a properly designed 
IS system Such systems shall be designed and documented according to the standard IEC Intrinsically 
safe electrical systems installed according to IEC and inspected and maintained according to IEC Standards 
for intrinsic protection are mainly developed by IECInternational Electrotechnical Commission but different agencies also develop 
standards for intrinsic safety Agencies may be run by governments or may be composed of 
members from insurance companies manufacturers and industries with an interest in safety standards Certifying agencies 
allow manufacturers to affix a label or mark to identify that the equipment has been 
designed to the relevant product safety standards Examples of such agencies in North America are 
the Factory Mutual Research Corporation which certifies radios Underwriters Laboratories UL that certifies mobile phones 
and in Canada the Canadian Standards In the EU the standard for intrinsic safety certification 
is the CENELEC standard EN and shall be certified according to the ATEX directive while 
in other countries around the world the IEC standards are followed To facilitate world trade 
standards agencies around the world engage in harmonization activity so that intrinsically safe equipment manufactured 
in one country eventually might be approved for use in another without redundant expensive testing

Giuseppe "Joe" Profaci Italian dʒuˈzɛppe proˈfaːtʃi; October – June was an Italianborn New York City La 
Cosa Nostra boss who was the founder of what became the Colombo crime family Established 
in this was the last of the Five Families to be organized He was the 
family's boss for over three decades Giuseppe Profaci was born in Villabate in the Province 
of Palermo Sicily on October In Profaci spent one year in prison in Palermo on 
theft Profaci's sons were Frank Profaci and John Profaci Sr Frank eventually joined the Profaci 
crime family while John Sr followed legitimate Two of Profaci's daughters married the sons of 
Detroit Partnership mobsters William Tocco and Joseph Profaci's brother was Salvatore Profaci who served as 
his consigliere for years and is known to have been heavily into dealing of pornographic 
materials One of Profaci's brothersinlaw was Joseph Magliocco who would eventually become Profaci's underboss Profaci's 
niece Rosalie Profaci was married to Salvatore Bonanno the son of Bonanno crime family boss 
Joseph Bonanno Profaci was the uncle of Salvatore Profaci Jr also a member of the 
Profaci crime Rosalie Profaci offered the following description of her uncle He was a flamboyant 
man who smoked big cigars drove big black Cadillacs and did things like buy tickets 
to a Broadway play for us cousins But he didn't buy two or three or 
even four seats he bought a whole Released from prison in Profaci emigrated to the 
United States arriving in New York City on September Profaci settled in Chicago where he 
opened a grocery store and bakery However the business was unsuccessful and in Profaci relocated 
to New York where he entered the olive oil import On September Profaci became a 
United States At some point after his move to Brooklyn Profaci became involved with local 
gangs On December Profaci attended a mob meeting in Cleveland Ohio that would make him 
an organized crime boss in Brooklyn In October Brooklyn boss Salvatore D'Aquila was murdered An 
important part of the Cleveland meeting attended by mobsters from Tampa Florida Chicago and Brooklyn 
was to appoint Profaci as Aquila's replacement so as to maintain calm among the Brooklyn 
Magliocco was named as Profaci's secondincommand Given Profaci's lack of experience in organized crime it 
is unclear why the New York gangs gave him power in Brooklyn Some speculated that 
Profaci received this position due to his family's status in Sicily where they may have 
belonged to the Villabate Mafia Profaci may have also benefited from contacts made through his 
olive oil Cleveland police eventually raided the meeting and expelled the mobsters from Cleveland but 
Profaci's business was accomplished By Profaci was controlling numbers prostitution loansharking and narcotics trafficking in 
Brooklyn In the Castellammarese War broke out in New York City Some sources say that 
Profaci remained neutral while others say that Profaci was firmly aligned with Castellammarese boss Salvatore 
When the war finally ended in top mobster Charles "Lucky" Luciano reorganized the New York 
gangs into five organized crime families At this point Profaci was recognized as boss of 
what was now the Profaci crime family with Magliocco as underboss and Salvatore Profaci as 
consigliere When Luciano created the National Crime Syndicate also known as the Mafia Commission he 
gave Profaci a seat on the governing board Profaci's closest ally on the board was 
Bonanno who would cooperate with Profaci over the next years Profaci was also allied with 
Stefano Magaddino the boss of the Buffalo crime family Profaci obtained most of his wealth 
through traditional illegal enterprises such as protection rackets and extortion However to protect himself from 
federal tax evasion charges Profaci still maintained his original olive oil business known as Mamma 
Mia Importing Company leading to his nickname as "Olive Oil As the demand for olive 
oil skyrocketed after World War II his business thrived Profaci owned other businesses that employed 
hundreds of workers in New Profaci owned a large house in Bensonhurst Brooklyn a home 
in Miami Beach Florida and an estate near Hightstown New Jersey which previously belonged to 
President Theodore Roosevelt Profaci's estate had its own airstrip and a chapel with an altar 
that replicated one in St Peter's Basilica in Profaci was a devout Catholic who made 
generous cash donations to Catholic charities A member of the Knights of Columbus Profaci would 
invite priests to his estate to celebrate Mass In May a thief stole valuable jeweled 
crowns from the Regina Pacis Votive shrine in Brooklyn Profaci sent his men to recover 
the crowns and reportedly kill the thief However accounts of the thief being strangled with 
a rosary are In the Vatican received a petition from a group of New York 
Catholics to confer a knighthood on Profaci However when the Brooklyn District Attorney complained about 
the move the Vatican denied the In the US Internal Revenue Service sued Profaci for 
over million in unpaid income The taxes were still unpaid when Profaci died nine years 
In the US Department of Justice moved to revoke Profaci's citizenship The government claimed that 
when Profaci entered the United States in he lied to immigration officials about having no 
arrest record in Italy In a US Court of Appeals reversed Profaci's deportation order ending 
the legal In law enforcement recorded a phone conversation between Profaci and Antonio Cottone a 
Sicilian mafioso about exporting Sicilian oranges to the United States In US Customs agents intercepted 
one of those orange crates in New York The crate contained wax oranges containing a 
total pounds of pure heroin Smugglers in Sicily had filled the hollow oranges with heroin 
until they weighed as much as real oranges then packed them in the Profaci was 
never prosecuted for this crime In Profaci attended the Apalachin Conference a national mob meeting 
at the farm of mobster Joseph Barbara in Apalachin New York While the conference was 
in progress New York State Troopers surrounded the farm and raided it Profaci was one 
of over mobsters arrested that day On January Profaci and others were convicted of conspiracy 
and he was sentenced to five years in prison However on November a United States 
Court of Appeals overturned the In contrast to Profaci's generosity to his relatives and the 
church many of his soldati considered him miserly and mean with money One reason for 
their rancor was that Profaci required each family member to pay him a a month 
tithe an old Sicilian gang custom The money which amounted to approximately a month was 
meant to support the families of mobsters in prison However most of this money stayed 
with Profaci In addition Profaci did not tolerate any dissent from his policies People who 
expressed discontent were On February the Gallos led by Joe Gallo kidnapped four of Profaci's 
top men underboss Magliocco Frank Profaci Joe Profaci's brother capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John 
Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in While holding the hostages Larry and 
Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme 
for the hostages' release Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand before negotiations but 
his brother Larry overruled him After a few weeks of negotiation Profaci made a deal 
with the Profaci's consigliere Charles "the Sidge" LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the 
hostages were released However Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement On August 
Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph "Joe Jelly" Gioielli and Larry Gallo 
Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioilli after inviting him to go Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt 
in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore "Sally" D'Ambrosio after 
a police officer The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and 
his The Gallos then began calling Persico "The Snake" after he had betrayed the war 
continued on resulting in nine murders and three With the start of the gang war 
the Gallo crew retreated to the By Profaci's health was failing In early Carlo Gambino 
and Lucchese crime family boss Tommy Lucchese tried to convince Profaci to resign to end 
the gang war However Profaci strongly suspected that the two bosses were secretly supporting the 
Gallo brothers and wanted to take control of his family Profaci vehemently refused to resign; 
furthermore he warned that any attempt to remove him would spark a wider gang war 
Gambino and Lucchese did not pursue their On June Profaci died in South Side Hospital 
in Bay Shore New York of liver He is buried at Saint John Cemetery in 
the Middle Village section of Queens in one of the largest mausoleums in the After 
Profaci's death Magliocco succeeded him as head of the In late the Mafia Commission forced 
Magliocco out of office and installed Joseph Colombo as family At this point the Profaci

The fire triangle or combustion triangle is a simple model for understanding the necessary ingredients 
for most The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite heat fuel 
and an oxidizing agent usually A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and 
combined in the right meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing 
A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in 
the fire triangle For example covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen 
part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire In large fires where firefighters are 
called in decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is 
no effective way to make that happen in an extended The fire tetrahedron represents the 
addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction to the three already present in 
the fire triangle Once a fire has started the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the 
fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements 
of the fire is blocked Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen 
it needs Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the 
ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel Halon can be used to remove 
free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the 
chemical reaction responsible for the Combustion is the chemical reaction that feeds a fire more 
heat and allows it to continue When the fire involves burning metals like lithium magnesium 
etc known as a classD fire it becomes even more important to consider the energy 
release The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is 
released Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even 
exploding Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as Therefore inert agents eg 
dry sand must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion In the 
same way as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is removed 
combustion stops The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction In most cases 
it is the ambient air and in particular one of its components oxygen By depriving 
a fire of air it can be extinguished; for example when covering the flame of 
a small candle with an empty glass fire stops; to the contrary if air is 
blown over a wood fire with bellows the fire is activated by the introduction of 
more air Some chemicals such as fluorine gas perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate or 
chlorine trifluoride act as oxidisers sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself A fire based 
on a reaction with these oxidisers can be very difficult to put out until the 
oxidiser is exhausted; that leg of the fire triangle cannot be broken by normal means 
ie depriving it of air will not smother it In certain cases such as some 
explosives the oxidizer and combustible are the same eg nitroglycerin an unstable molecule that has 
oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts Reaction is initiated by an 
activating energy in most cases it is heat Several examples include friction as in case 
of matches heating an electrical wire a flame propagation of fire or a spark from 
a lighter or from any starting electrical device There are also many other ways to 
bring sufficient activation energy including electricity radiation and pressure all of which will lead to 
a temperature rise In most cases heat production enables selfsustainability of the reaction and enables 
a chain reaction to grow The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to 
get a flammable mix with selfsustainable combustion is called its flashpoint To stop a combustion 
reaction one of the three elements of the firetriangle has to be removed Without sufficient 
heat a fire cannot begin and it cannot continue Heat can be removed by the 
application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction 
This is often water which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam Introducing 
sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of 
heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner Scraping embers from a burning 
structure also removes the heat source Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes 
the ignition source Without fuel a fire will stop Fuel can be removed naturally as 
where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel or manually by mechanically or chemically 
removing the fuel from the fire Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire 
suppression and is the basis for most major tactics such as controlled burns The fire 
stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease 
in energy release and a lower temperature Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat Without 
sufficient oxygen a fire cannot begin and it cannot continue With a decreased oxygen concentration 
the combustion process slows Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide 
fire extinguisher a fire blanket or water Water can have two different roles In the 
case of a solid combustible the solid fuel produces pyrolyzing products under the influence of 
heat commonly radiation This process is halted by the application of water since water is 
more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed Thereby energy is removed from the fuel 
surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped removing the fuel supply to 
the flames In fire fighting this is referred to as surface cooling In the gas 
phase ie in the flames or in the smoke the combustible can not be separated 
from the oxidizer and the only possible action consists of cooling down In this case 
water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase thereby lowering the temperature and adding water 
vapour making the gas mixture non combustible This requires droplets of a size less than 
about In fire fighting this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling Cases 
also exist where the ignition factor is not the activation energy For example a smoke 
explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by 
a sudden fresh air input oxidizer input The interval in which an airgas mix can 
burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air This interval can be very 
small kerosene or large acetylene Water cannot be used on certain type of fires Since 
these reactions are well understood it has been possible to create specific wateradditives which will 
allow Wateradditives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires class A 
+ class B or even class A + class B + class F meaning a 
better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires 
or fires that involve several different classes of materials In the context of wildland fire 
the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to understand fire spread over landscapes 
scales of days and several km and recurrence of fire over time scales of decades 
and hundreds of Thus while heat is important to ignite a flame topography is important 
for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels and ignitions sources are important to 
help explain recurrence on longer time scales Similarly while oxygen is relevant to sustain a 
flame weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire and the longerterm pattern 
of weather is summarized as climate Lastly fuels is the term to describe what burns 
in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire but 
fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation At the 
smallest scale the combustion fire triangle individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical 
temperature and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings Combustion events range on the scale 
of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the 
quadrant scale The largest scale in contrast describes the fire regime concept Global climate change 
drives many of the factors involved in the 'wildfire' and the 'fire regime' triangles For 
example with respect to the fire regime a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic 
fire in terms of recurrence intensity seasonality and biological effects; a change in vegetation type 
The North Toronto railway station is a former Canadian Pacific Railway CPR in the northwest 
corner of the Rosedale neighbourhood of Toronto Ontario Canada It is located on the east 
side of Yonge Street adjacent to the neighbourhood of Summerhill and a short distance south 
of the Summerhill TTC subway station It is now home to a Liquor Control Board 
of Ontario LCBO liquor store The station constructed in the Beaux Arts tradition consists of 
a clock tower and a threestorey main terminal The tower is modelled after the Campanile 
di San Marco in Saint Mark's Square in Venice The main terminal gallery has an 
high ceiling supported by marble walls and with elegant bronze suspended light fixtures The foot 
print of the station is feet inches by feet inches and that of the clock 
tower is feet inches according to plans published in the August edition of Canadian Railway 
and Marine World The North Toronto Station was the first building in the city to 
be constructed of Tyndall limestone from Manitoba supplied by The Wallace Sandstone Quarries The material 
is noted for its weather resistance embedded fossils and dappled beige hues The four clock 
faces each metres in diameter were always illuminated at night during the station's service life 
The station was designed by Darling and Pearson and built in by P Lyall Sons 
Construction Company to service the Canadian Pacific Railway CPR line running across Toronto The cornerstone 
was laid on September by Mayor Tommy Church and the station officially opened for passenger 
service on June though it had already been serving in the role since June The 
station was built at a cost of in The current structure replaced a more modest 
railway station to the west of Yonge The two structures existed together for a time 
an existing photograph circa showing the two buildings is currently held in the City of 
Toronto Archive Canada's first shipment of whale meat passed through the station circa When Union 
Station opened in and the Great Depression followed shortly thereafter the North Toronto Station which 
served smaller towns in Ontario and was originally meant to augment the bigger station began 
to suffer The last paying passengers filed through the station on September Brewers' Retail moved 
into the northern portion of the terminal building in The station was reopened briefly at 
on May when King George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth mother of Queen Elizabeth 
II arrived for their first visit to Toronto This was the "first visit to Canada 
by a reigning British The king was also officially a Canadian monarch marking the first 
visit by one to the city The couple departed Toronto through Union Station Shortly after 
World War II returning soldiers passed through the station; they were its last rail passengers 
On September a time capsule was entombed in the tonnes cornerstone laid by the then 
mayor of Toronto Tommy Church The capsule was found and opened years later in September 
It contained around items including blueprints an old map of Toronto six newspapers from September 
coins and a City of Toronto municipal handbook The items were found in exceptional condition 
with only yellowing pages on the newspapers and tarnish on the coins A new capsule 
was buried in the space occupied by the former that included items from September issues 
of the Toronto Star The Globe and Mail and National Post a copy of the 
September issue of Toronto Life magazine and the current edition of the LCBO Food Drink 
guide were included Also buried were a BlackBerry and an iPhone a modern map of 
Toronto and a few bottles of spirits in homage to the current use of the 
building as an LCBO Though the former beauty of the station's exterior could be surmised 
even in its most downtrodden days much of the station's elegant interior was hidden behind 
boardings put up by Brewers' Retail and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario LCBO the 
governmentowned alcohol retailer which had moved into the southern part of the terminal building in 
until the building was restored in by Woodcliffe Corporation The architects were Goldsmith Borgal Company 
Ltd Architects and Eastern Construction was contracted to do the work The clocks had been 
removed from the tower between and allowing pigeons to enter the structure through holes in 
the clock faces The first order of business during the restoration of the tower was 
the removal of approximately kilograms of desiccated pigeon droppings that had accumulated in its base 
The original movements of the clocks themselves were almost completely recovered and restored; now with 
the help of GPS signals they display the time with much greater precision and reliability 
The building is protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since October The 
building was a former Heritage Railway Station but was removed from the list of protected 
stations as a railway no longer owned the property A Heritage Easement has been placed 
on the property since December The City of Toronto also lists the building as part 
of the South Rosedale Heritage Conservation Though it now serves as the Summerhill LCBO outlet 
the largest liquor store in Canada freight trains still run behind the station During restoration 
to break up traininduced vibrations that might otherwise rattle bottles and 'bruise' more expensive merchandise 
the concrete floor was impregnated with rubber from discarded automobile tires A Piazza called Scrivener 
Square named in honour of Margaret Scrivener with a tipping water fountain provides a wide 
public space on the southern aspect In the GO Transit first proposed reintroducing passenger service 
for commuters through North Toronto station in the form of a ‘Midtown’ line allowing commuter 
traffic to run between the existing Kipling and Agincourt stations without travelling through the city 
centre A new transit plan announced by Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty in included a proposal 
to institute a Midtown corridor and this was repeated by Metrolinx in their regional transportation 
plan The Big Move In addition it has been suggestedby whom that the station could 
be used for some Via Rail and Ontario Northland trains in order to relieve congestion 
at Union Station or as a branch of a future cityairport rail link The original 
building measured feet inches by feet inches with a midway and baggage room built under 
the tracks that measured feet inches by feet inch and clock tower was feet inches 
The clock tower stands feet tall and estimating from the photographs the main building is 
about feet high Once entered the building only has one floor with the rails elevated 
by an embankment that allows passage underneath without having to change floors Additions in added 
a triangular section to the north side of the building that includes more retail space 
and a loading dock pushing the west façade tight to the side walk bordering Yonge 
Street and also extending the eastern side of the building to include another loading dock 
The scale is quite grand and is apparent by the foot high ceiling as one 
enters into what once was the main waiting area The public areas are at a 
large scale that tapers once one circulates to the midway under the tracks and would 
have opened up again once one were to move up to the platform because at 
the time of construction the embankment built for the tracks would have been one of 
the higher points in the vicinity The choice of materials is quite monochromatic from the 
beige Tyndall limestone from Manitoba the beige brown and green marble throughout the interior and 
light brown terrazzo for the flooring There are only a few variations from this palette 
and are made to be very meaningful They are the ornate white plaster ceilings of 
the waiting room and green copper spire of the clock tower Even the steel used 
for the overpass and the covered area outside are of a similar palette The building 
is very approachable because of the materials chosen They work well on the large scale 
to give the building weight and solidity but as one more closely inspects the materiality 
the scale will change with the slight rustication of the limestone showing fossil evidence and 
the veining of the marble unique in every square foot The station can be broken 
down into three main areas the main building encompassing the waiting room ticket office and 
concourse; the clock tower; and the area underneath the tracks that include the midway and 
baggage area leading up to the platforms The breaking down of components into 'threes' figures 
heavily in the building from three separate programmatic elements to the main building being broken 
down into three sections Having the elevation drop on either side to give it an 
ABA rhythm breaks the main building into three and the groupings go further There are 
three very large arched windows with the main entrance set at ground level in the 
center At ground level there is also a grouping of three smaller windows set to 
either side of the entrance under the large arched windows as well as a grouping 
the same size to either side Vertically the elevation is also broken into three main 
components the ground level which is given a human scale with the overhang and included 
smaller windows and entrance; the second level is the tallest and includes three large arched 
windows; and the third grouping a relatively simple frieze cornice and parapet The plaster ceiling 
in the waiting room is also broken into three sections by two large beams and 
unity is drawn from outside to inside by the dentil detail in the plaster and 
on the cornice The interior also follows the same hierarchy as the exterior by having 
changes in the wall treatments The marble makes a break at what seems to be 
traditional ceiling height to give the retail space a human scale while the rest of 
walls are pure marble all the way the ceiling which makes the third part The 
concourse which is still in the main building but acts as a transition to the 
area underneath the tracks has a vaulted ceiling broken in the three separate elements The 
clock tower also follows this rule of threes In elevation it has a heavy robust 
base that is taller than the rest of the building This is topped with another 
section that is more ornate yet lighter detailed with two columns to make three bays 
and finally the actual clock and roof The clock tower is modeled after the Campanile 
of St Mark's in Venice which had collapsed and was being rebuilt shortly before the 
construction of the station It is an interesting effect of the tower getting lighter with 
higher elevation The bottom tier is mostly stone with only a vertical line of very 
narrow fenestration The second tier becomes much lighter with the intercolumnation and having the stone 
wall set a distance behind the columns to give it the depth needed to create 
a sense of openness The third tier completes the lightness by becoming narrower and employing

The Florianturm Florian Tower Florian for short is a telecommunications tower and landmark of Dortmund 
Germany It is named after St Florian the patron saint of gardeners The Florianturm is 
the TV tower of Dortmund and was built in as an attraction for a federal 
horticultural show with a height of metres At the time it was briefly the highest 
freestanding structure in Germany The tower was constructed similarly to a high concrete chimney It 
consists of a reinforced concrete tube which tapers off as it rises reaching a height 
of metres At metres there is a building part with two floors On the lower 
floor there are operation rooms and on the upper floor at metres there is a 
revolving restaurant At metres and metres there are two observation decks On the upper observation 
deck there are installations and aerials of Deutsche Telekom Since it has been used for 
transmitting television signals On September a Russian helicopter was used to replace the aerial Since 
then a transmitter has transmitted digital terrestrial television programmes for the Dortmund area Since September 
the Florianturm has a height of metres making it the fourteenth highest structure in Germany 
From to the tower was renovated and safety standards were brought up to date In 
a catwalk for bungee jumping was opened on the upper platform It was closed in

After eight years in the presidential office during Reconstruction Ulysses S Grant looked forward to 
retirement from public life When his second term in office ended in Grant had gained 
weight while he desired to travel the world and visit his daughter in Scotland Grant 
began his postpresidential life with a twoyear tour that took him and his wife and 
entourage around the world On returning Grant was welcomed home with an adoration unknown since 
the end of the Civil War and he began to consider running for a third 
term as president in Following a hardfought defeat at the Republican National Convention that year 
Grant embarked on a financial career in partnership with Ferdinand Ward but the venture failed 
and Grant was nearly bankrupted Diagnosed with cancer in he began writing his memoirs as 
a way to tell his story and provide for his family after his death The 
book finished just before his death the following year was a huge success and remains 
in print Grant was interred in Grant's Tomb a massive mausoleum in New York City 
In the collected scandals of the last eight years led many in the Republican party 
to repudiate Bristow was among the leading candidates to replace him suggesting that a large 
faction desired an end to "Grantism" and feared that Grant would run for a third 
Ultimately Grant did not run but neither was Bristow the nominee as the convention settled 
on Governor Rutherford B Hayes of Ohio a reformer The Democrats nominated Samuel J Tilden 
of New York and the election that year was undecided for several months due to 
voting irregularities in three Southern Grant assured both sides that he would not use the 
army to force a result and agreed to the formation of an Electoral Commission to 
decide the The result was the Compromise of Hayes was elected but the last troops 
would be withdrawn from Southern The Republicans had won but Reconstruction was over Leaving the 
White House Grant and family stayed with friends in New York Ohio and Philadelphia for 
two months before setting out on a tour of the The trip which would last 
two years began in Liverpool in May where enormous crowds greeted the expresident and his 
Travelling to London the Grants dined with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle and Grant gave 
several speeches in the They next traveled to Belgium Germany and Switzerland before returning to 
England There they spent a few months with their daughter Nellie who had married an 
Englishman and moved to that country several years before Returning to the continent Grant and 
his wife journeyed on to France and Italy spending Christmas aboard USS Vandalia a warship 
docked in After a winter sojourn in the Holy Land they visited Greece before returning 
to Italy and a meeting with Pope Leo Travelling to Spain and then to Germany 
again Grant met with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck; the two men discussed military After another 
visit to England and then to Ireland the Grants left Europe by ship sailing through 
the Suez Canal to India They visited Bombay Lucknow Varanasi and Delhi being welcomed in 
each city by the colonial After India it was on to Burma Siam where Grant 
met King Chulalongkorn Singapore and Traveling on to Hong Kong Grant began to change his 
mind on the nature of colonization believing that the British rule was not "purely selfish" 
but also good for the colonial Leaving Hong Kong the Grants entered China proper seeing 
the cities of Canton Shanghai and Peking He declined to request an interview with the 
Guangxu Emperor a child of seven but did speak with the head of government Prince 
Gong and Li Hongzhang a leading They discussed China's dispute with Japan over the Ryukyu 
Islands and Grant agreed to help bring the two sides to After crossing over to 
Japan and meeting the Emperor Meiji Grant convinced China to acquiesce in Japanese annexation of 
the islands and the two nations avoided By then the Grants had been gone two 
years and were homesick They crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 
greeted by cheering After a visit to Yellowstone National Park they returned at last to 
Philadelphia on December The twoandahalfyear voyage around the world had captured popular imagination and Republicans—especially 
those of the new Stalwart faction who had excluded from the Hayes administration—saw Grant in 
a new With Hayes having forsworn a second term when he was elected the nomination 
for was wide open and many thought that Grant was the man for the The 
Stalwarts led by Grant's old political ally Roscoe Conkling saw the expresident's renewed popularity as 
a way for their faction to regain prominence Grant said nothing publicly but privately he 
wanted the job and encouraged his Elihu B Washburne wrote to Grant in February urging 
him to run; Grant demurred saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win 
with another candidate though he preferred James G Blaine to John Even so Conkling and 
John A Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor When the convention convened in 
Chicago in June there were more delegates pledge to Grant than to any other candidate 
but he was short of a Grant's popularity was high but fading Washburne conjectured that 
had Grant stayed abroad longer the wave of adulation that greeted him on his return 
might have carried him all the way back to the White Conkling placed Grant's name 
in nomination with an elegant speech his most famous line being "When asked which state 
he hails from our sole reply shall be he hails from Appomattox and its famous 
apple With votes needed for nomination the first ballot had Grant at Blaine at Sherman 
at and the rest scattered to minor Subsequent ballots followed with roughly the same result; 
neither Grant nor Blaine could After thirtysix ballots Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with 
those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate Representative James A Garfield of Grant 
received votes on the final ballot his supporters staying committed to their man to the 
bitter Logan moved that the nomination be made unanimous and it was but those Stalwarts 
were immortalized in Republican Grant accepted his defeat even claiming to be relieved at the 
He gave speeches for Garfield but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee Winfield Scott Hancock 
a general who had served under Grant in the Army of the Garfield was elected 
by a narrow popular margin but a solid Electoral College to After the election Grant 
gave Garfield his public support but also pushed him to include Stalwarts in his Grant's 
world tour although successful was costly When he returned to America Grant had depleted most 
of his savings and needed to earn To that end Grant Jay Gould and former 
Mexican Finance Secretary Matías Romero chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad which planned to build a 
railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico At the same time Grant used his influence to convince 
Chester A Arthur who had succeeded Garfield as president in to negotiate a free trade 
treaty with Mexico Arthur and the Mexican government agreed but the United States Senate rejected 
the treaty in The railroad was similarly unsuccessful falling into bankruptcy the following At the 
same time Grant's son Ulysses Jr "Buck" had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with 
Ferdinand Ward Ward was regarded as a rising star and the firm Grant Ward was 
initially In Grant joined the firm and invested of his own The firm's success attracted 
more investors who bought securities through them then used the securities as collateral to borrow 
money to buy more securities Grant Ward then pledged that collateral to borrow more money 
to trade in securities on the firm's own account The practice–called hypothecation–was legal and accepted; 
what was illegal was rehypothecation the practice of pledging the same securities as collateral for 
multiple Ward with the collusion of the bank involved did this for many of the 
firm's assets If the trades resulted in profit then there would be no problem; if 
they went bad however multiple loans would come due all backed up by the same 
collateral Historians acknowledge that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's tactics but it is unclear 
how much Buck Grant knew In May enough investments went bad to convince Ward that 
the firm would soon be bankrupted He told Grant of the impending failure but suggested 
that it was a temporary Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt who gave Grant a 
personal loan of Grant invested the money in the firm but it was not enough 
to save the firm from failure Essentially penniless but compelled by a sense of personal 
honor Grant repaid Vanderbilt with his Civil War mementos Although the market value did not 
cover the loan Vanderbilt insisted it was paid in full The matter left Grant financially 
Grant learned in that he was suffering from throat He had forfeited his military pension 
when he assumed the Presidency but Congress subsequently restored Grant to the rank of General 
of the Army with full retirement At the suggestion of Robert Johnson Grant wrote several 
articles on his Civil War campaigns for The Century Magazine at each The articles were 
well received by critics and Johnson suggested Grant write a book of memoirs as Sherman 
and others had successfully Grant took up the project and asked an old friend and 
fellow writer Adam Badeau to review and critique his work Century offered Grant a book 
contract including a royalty When Grant shared this information with his friend Mark Twain Twain 
suggested that Grant counter with a request for double the royalty; at the same time 
he made his own offer to Grant for his memoirs talking of a royalty Grant 
ultimately decided on Twain's company Charles L Webster and Co as his publisher His son 
Fred assisted primarily with references and proofing Grant finished his memoir just a few days 
before his Twain created a unique marketing system designed to reach millions of veterans with 
a patriotic appeal just as the nation began mourning the war hero's death Ten thousand 
agents canvassed the North following a script Twain had devised; many were themselves veterans who 
dressed in their old uniforms They sold twovolume sets at prices from to depending on 
the binding Each copy contained what looked like a handwritten note from Grant himself In 
the end Grant's widow Julia received about suggesting a royalty of about The Personal Memoirs 
of Ulysses S Grant has been highly regarded by the general public military historians and 
literary Grant was a shrewd intelligent and effective writer He portrayed himself in the persona 
of the honorable Western hero whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness He candidly 
depicts his battles against both the external Confederates and internal Army Three days after finishing 
his memoirs Grant died of throat cancer at the age of in a cottage at 
the top of Mount McGregor in upstate New York His last words were "I hope 
that nobody will be distressed on my Commanding General of the United States Army Philip 
Sheridan ordered a daylong tribute to Grant on all military posts and a sixmonth mourning 
among West Point cadets President Grover Cleveland ordered a thirtyday nationwide period of mourning Private 
services were held in Mount McGregor on August After lying in state in the New 
York State Capitol at Albany Grant's body was placed on a funeral train and traveled 
via West Point to New York City where a quarter of a million people viewed 
in the two days prior to the funeral His funeral was held August in New 
York and was supervised by Military Division of the Atlantic head Winfield Scott Hancock It 
featured a procession of men many of them veterans from the Grand Army of the

dozen horses between New York City Hall and Riverside Park His pallbearers included Generals Sherman 
Sheridan Buckner and Johnston as well as GAR head John A Logan and admiral David 
Dixon Porter Attendance at the New York funeral purportedly topped million In the days before 
and after the funeral ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country Those 
who eulogized Grant in the press likened him to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln then 
the nation's two greatest His body was interred in New York City's Riverside Park first 
in a temporary tomb and later in General Grant National Memorial "Grant's Tomb" the largest

Team Rubicon is an International nongovernment organization NGO founded by US Marines William McNulty and 
Jacob "Jake" Team Rubicon identifies itself as a veteran service organization that uses disaster response 
to help reintegrate veterans back into civilian Team Rubicon formed in January following the Haiti 
earthquake when William McNulty and Jacob "Jake" led a medical team into PortauPrince three days 
after the earthquake The first Team Rubicon was an initial team of eight They gathered 
funds and medical supplies from friends and family and flew into the Dominican Republic They 
rented a truck loaded their gear and headed west to Haiti The team treated thousands 
of patients traveling to camps deemed “too dangerous” by other aid organizations They ventured outside 
the traditional scale of disaster response focusing on those who would be overlooked The experience 
was the beginning of Team Team Rubicon wanted to solve two problems Inadequate disaster response 
which is often slow to respond has an antiquated infrastructure and is not using the 
best technological solutions or welltrained members and inadequate veteran reintegration into civilian life where military 
veterans whose training skills and experience makes them very effective in disaster response can reduce 
suicide within their community and address integration issues by helping others in an opportunity to 
provide service to The death of fellow Rubicon member Clay Hunt from suicide refocused Team 
Rubicon's organizational mission on to veteran reintegration The team's role in domestic disasters is both 
to provide humanitarian assistance and as an outlet to let veterans continue to Similar to 
other veteran integration programs using models found in initiatives like Team Red White Blue and 
the Wounded Warrior Project Team Rubicon shifted its focus on helping veterans – the organizations 
often work The name Rubicon is from the phrase "crossing the Rubicon" an idiom to 
mean passing a point of no The red and dark gray logo is made up 
of a sideways cross a traditional symbol of first aid but here on its side 
as a departure from the traditional with a river running through the logo as a 
symbol of the gap between disasters and disaster Wood and his work with Team Rubicon

"The Blessed Damozel" is perhaps the best known poem by Dante Gabriel Rossetti as well 
as the title of some of his best known paintings The poem was first published 
in in the PreRaphaelite journal The Germ Rossetti subsequently revised the poem twice and republished 
it in and The poem was partially inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poem "The with 
its depiction of a lover grieving on Earth over the death of his loved one 
Rossetti chose to represent the situation in reverse The poem describes the damozel observing her 
lover from heaven and her unfulfilled yearning for their reunion in heaven The poem also 
was the inspiration for Claude Debussy's La Damoiselle élue a cantata for two soloists female 
choir and orchestra The first four stanzas of the poem are inscribed on the frame 
of the painting The blessed damozel leaned out From the gold bar of Heaven; Her 
eyes were deeper than the depth Of waters stilled at even; She had three lilies 
in her hand And the stars in her hair were seven Her robe ungirt from 
clasp to hem No wrought flowers did adorn But a white rose of Mary's gift 
For service meetly worn; Her hair that lay along her back Was yellow like ripe 
corn Herseemed she scarce had been a day One of God's choristers; The wonder was 
not yet quite gone From that still look of hers; Albeit to them she left 
her day Had counted as ten years To one it is ten years of years 
Yet now and in this place Surely she leaned o'er me—her hair Fell all about 
my face Nothing the autumn fall of leaves The whole year sets The Blessed Damozel 
is the only one of Rossetti's paired pictures and poems in which the poem was 
completed first Friends and patrons repeatedly urged Rossetti to illustrate his most famous and he 
finally accepted a commission from William Graham in February After the work was completed Graham 
requested a predella the lower part of the painting on December His total cost was

commissions Soon after Leyland acquired his first Rossetti painting he and Rossetti explored the idea 
of a Rossetti triptych which was eventually formed with Mnemosyne an replica of The Blessed 
Damozel painted by Rossetti himself and Three additional Rossetti paintings were then hung in Leyland's 
drawing room all of which Leyland called Several pieces of music were based on the

Barrydale is a village located on the border of the Overberg and Klein Karoo regions 
of the Western Cape Province in South Africa Named after Joseph Barry a well known 
merchant of the it is situated at the northern end of the Tradouw's pass which 
winds its way through the mountains to Swellendam Barrydale's history dates back to the early 
century when farmers moved into the area looking for fertile arable land with water The 
community built their church on a spot where the and roads meet In the days 
before the church was built there were a number of nagmaal houses houses where Holy 
Communion could be celebrated and a school but not much else The Dutch Reformed Community 
of Barrydale came into being in when land was purchased to build the church As 
the farmers in the area were encouraged to plant vineyards and orchards it was natural 
that a winery and distillery would eventually be built In the Barrydale Koöperatiewe Wynkelder was 
formed and a distillery established giving rise to the wine industry in the area Joseph 
Barry Brandy produced locally was voted best brandy in the world in Over the years 
the village grew and eventually a municipality was established in Today there is an estimated 
population of permanent residents The population increases dramatically in the tourist season with visitors drawn 
by arts and crafts displays including textiles jewellery and African souvenirs Barrydale has a temperate 
climate of warm dry summers with averages of occasionally up to and mild wet winters 
when the temperature occasionally dips to around accompanied by light frosts The warm temperate climate 
is perfect for the growth of various fruit trees with numerous orchards on the fertile 
soils of the Tradouw Valley Apples pears and oranges are harvested in the winter and 
crops of apricots figs cling peaches and grapes in the summer The town still shows 
the legacy of the apartheid era when it was divided in two to separate whites 
from nonwhites a large proportion of which are direct descendants of the indigenous Khoisan tribe 
Barrydale is culturally diverse for a small village with English and Afrikaansspeaking inhabitants as well 
as a substantial European expatriate community including French German Spanish and Italian residents The annual 
Barrydale Spring Festival in October is an important event on the town's calendar The Joseph

course through the pass Barrydale and the surrounding area is rich in species diversity with 
abundant wildlife such as baboons genets mongooses klipspringer small khakicoloured antelope often seen perched on 
rocks and rock hyraxes known locally as dassies smaller relatives of the elephant More elusive 
animals such as porcupines aardvarks jackals otters and the reclusive leopards are occasionally seen in 
the mountains Reptiles are common especially snakes with a few poisonous species such as puff 
adder boomslang tree snake and Cape cobra The area is also home to numerous bird 
species such as the Cape eagleowl hadeda ibis grey heron sunbird these often have iridescent 
plumage fiscal shrike which impales its prey on acacia thorns or barbed wire and black 
eagles often seen soaring high overhead on the thermals The area has many rare plant 
species notably the fynbos flora on the slopes of the Langeberg mountain range in the 
south and succulentdominated Karroid flora to the north There are many private and state reserves

Darkside is a philosophical comedy radio drama written by Tom Stoppard produced and directed by 
James Robinson and based on the themes of Pink Floyd's progressive rock album The Dark 
Side of the Moon Stoppard was first approached with the idea of writing a play 
based on the album in but had "no idea" how to approach it until much 
BBC's radio drama producer James Robinson said that the initial idea was "to see what 
sort of a journey the album takes Tom Stoppard on" Stoppard used all of the 
album apart from lyrics as "a kind of underscore" taking emotional cues from the music 
He contacted Pink Floyd's David Gilmour who gave Stoppard permission to write dialogue that would 
be heard over the instrumental pieces and found the resulting script On adapting the album 
Stoppard stated "I didn't try to make a story that was the album writ large 
in any way I invented a little story in the spirit of the album taking 
a cue as to what level of reality this story might be The following philosophical 
themes are present in the Aardman Animations created a threeminute short film to promote the 
play consisting of a montage depicting a world on the verge of collapse with huge 
ploughs destroying landscapes and skies filled with The short was directed by Darren Dubicki and 
was intended to evoke themes of "greed conflict and consumption" with the eventual message that 
"Life is futile and destined to descend into madness" The animators drew inspiration from the 
surreal album artwork by Storm Thorgerson and The play was broadcast on BBC Radio on 
August the year of the album's anniversary It was preceded by a number of programmes

typical of the GSWR at the time When the GSWR along with several other companies 
formed to make the GSR these locomotives were given the GSR Battleship grey livery In 
the CIE days they carried either the GSR grey or the new CIE green identical

The Miniature Railway at Silver Lake Ohio was a gauge miniature railway inaugurated by the 
Lodge family in at Silver Lake Ohio The ridable miniature railway was hauled by a 
scaled down steam locomotive but the open passenger cars had no role model The small 
locomotive was built around by the ArmitageHerschell Company of North Tonawanda in Niagara County New 
York as park railways became increasingly popular The locomotives of this manufacturer could pull up 
to ten passenger cars with seats for children or The steam locomotive its tender and 
three passenger cars were purchased for a price of for the locomotive and for each 
car equivalent to a price of per pound as the locomotive weighed pounds The Ohio 
Steel Company of Cuyahoga Falls made miniature rails with the unusually large weight of twice 
as heavy as those for other park railways as well as switches and their flangebearing 
frogs for The railway loop began south of the large pavilion built in The station 
was on the lakeshore at the boat landing dock The route led along the lakeshore 
passing an old log cabin next to the later aquarium It then passed the shooting 
gallery the stonebuilt ice store which was later rebuilt into the cage of the pumas 
as well as cages for monkeys a wolf raccoons a badger and foxes From there 
you could also see the aviaries for an eagle hawks and owls and the bear 
pits After the menagerie it led again along the lake passed the Linwood logcabin to 
another stretch along the lakeshore This original route allowed the passengers a view of the 
lake and the zoo animals which made the menagerie quickly However the miniature railway with 
this original route was not as profitable as it should have been because it was 
too far away from the main business The following year therefore the track was laid 
along a new route with a long detour This doubled the journey time and the 
train journey became very popular Over the years the route has been changed several Starting 
in the second summer the locomotive had to be repetitively repaired Steamboat engineer Frank Jones 
was a valuable aid in repairing the locomotive and its parts Nevertheless the locomotive was 
taken out of service and offered for Sammy Wise a person of short stature from 
Loudonville Ohio was employed as the first conductor of the park railway He was just 
inches m tall at the age of when he came to Silver Lake He was 
wellproportioned and selfimportant and very popular with campers and colleagues In his uniform with a 
shiny lantern on his left arm and his ticket punch in his right hand he 
was an attractive little conductor He worked with the park railroad for several summers until 
his death in the winter of George Lodge was very enthusiastic about the train and 
the locomotive that he had built together with Frank Jones and Sammy Wise in for 
several months using a new boiler of Biggs Boiler Works in In he built a 
more powerful locomotive which was eventually called the Little General and is now on display 
in Travel Town After Frank Jones had died he manufactured another even larger locomotive in 
his own workshop He also built five new cars so that two trains with four 
cars each could drive at the same The summer season of was the last time 
the park was operated but the park railroad continued to be popular and in operation 
The selling price of the park did not include the rails locomotives and trains Since 
William Lodge could not find another buyer he bought the rails and rolling stock for 
and stored them on his farm After a few years he sold the locomotive and 
wagons to Buckeye Lake Park Co in Licking County Ohio This operated the trains for 
several summers and then sold them to a park near Toledo where they were still 
in operation in Entrance to Silver Lake Akron Ohio Evening pleasures at Silver Lake Ohio

Saturn Films helped produce the film The film centers on a man who experiences what 
his life might have been if he had made a different decision earlier in his 
life Jack and Kate who have been together since college are at JFK Airport where 
Jack is about to leave to take up a twelvemonth internship with Barclays in London 
Kate fears the separation will be detrimental to their relationship and asks him not to 
go but he reassures her saying their love is strong enough to last and he 
flies out Thirteen years later Jack is now a bachelor living a carefree life as 
a Wall Street executive in New York City At work he is putting together a 
multibillion dollar merger and has ordered an emergency meeting on Christmas Day In his office 
on Christmas Eve he gets a message to contact Kate but even though he remembers 
her he dismisses it apparently uninterested On his way home he is in a convenience 
store when a young man Cash enters claiming to have a winning lottery ticket worth 
but the store clerk refuses him saying the ticket is a forgery Cash pulls out 
a gun and threatens him so Jack offers to buy the ticket and Cash eventually 
agrees Outside Jack tries to help Cash to which he responds by asking Jack if 
anything is missing from his life Jack says he has everything he needs whereupon Cash 
enigmatically remarks that Jack has brought upon himself what is now going to happen and 
walks away A puzzled Jack returns to his penthouse and sleeps On Christmas Day Jack 
wakes up in a suburban New Jersey bedroom with Kate and two children He rushes 
out to his condo and office in New York but both doormen refuse him entrance 
and do not recognize him Jack runs out into the street and encounters Cash driving 
Jack's Ferrari Although Cash offers to explain what is happening all he says is a 
vague reference to "The Organization" and that Jack is getting "a glimpse" that will help 
him to figure out for himself what it's about Jack slowly realizes that he is 
living the kind of life he might have had if he had stayed in the 
United States with Kate as she had asked He has a modest family life where 
he is a car tire salesman for Kate's father and Kate is a nonprofit lawyer 
Jack's young daughter Annie thinks he is an alien but a friendly one and assists 
him in fitting into his new life With a few setbacks Jack begins to succeed 
bonding with his children falling in love with his wife and working hard at his 
job Taking advantage of a chance meeting when his former boss chairman Peter Lassiter comes 
in to have a tire blowout fixed he impresses him with his business savvy and 
Lassiter invites him to his office where Jack worked in his 'other' life There after 
a short interview Lassiter offers him a position While he is excited by the potential 
salary and other perks Kate argues that they are very happy and they should be 
thankful for the life they have Having decided that he now likes this 'other' life 
Jack again sees Cash now a store clerk He demands to stay in this life 
but Cash tells him there is no choice "a glimpse" by definition is an impermanent 
thing That night Jack tries to stay awake but fails and wakes the "next day" 
Christmas Day to find himself in his original life He forgoes closing the acquisition deal 
to intercept Kate finding her moving out of a luxury townhouse before flying to Paris 
Like Jack she has focused on her career and has become a very wealthy corporate 
lawyer She had only called him to return a box of his old possessions He

Bothriechis schlegelii known commonly as the eyelash viper is a species of highly venomous pit 
viper in the family Viperidae The species is native to Central and South America Small 
and arboreal this species is characterized by a wide array of color variations as well 
as the superciliary scales above the eyes It is the most common of the green 
palmpitvipers genus and is often present in zoological exhibits The specific name schlegelii honors Hermann 
Schlegel who was a German ornithologist and For other common names see below No subspecies 
are currently recognized as being The eyelash viper is a relatively small species of pitviper 
with adults ranging from long and females being longer and more variable in size than 
males which can grow to It has a wide triangularshaped head and eyes with vertical 
pupils Like all pit vipers it is solenoglyphous having large hypodermic needlelike fangs in the 
front of the upper jaw that fold back when not in use and has heat 
sensitive organs or pits located on either side of the head between the eye and 
nostril Its most distinguishing feature and origin of its common name is the set of 
modified scales above the eyes that look much like eyelashes The eyelashes are thought to 
aid in camouflage breaking up the snake's outline among the foliage where it hides B 
schlegelii occurs in a wide range of colors including red yellow brown green even pink 
as well as various combinations thereof It often has black or brown speckling on the 
base color No external features distinguish the two Common names of B schlegelii include the 
eyelash eyelash pit viper eyelash palm viper eyelash Schlegel's Schlegel's pit Schlegel's palm eyelash eyelash 
eyelash mountain and horned palm In Spanish the primary language of countries comprising its distribution 
common names include oropel golden víbora bocaracá toboba víbora de eyelash viper and serpiente parrot 
snake The geographic range of B schlegelii extends from southern Mexico northern Chiapas southeastward on 
the Atlantic plains and lowlands through Central America to northern South America in Colombia and 
Venezuela It is also found on the Pacific versant and lowlands in parts of Costa 
Rica Panama Colombia Ecuador and Peru It occurs in mesic forest at elevations almost from 
sea level to altitude The type locality is “Popayan” Popayán B schlegelii prefers lower altitude 
humid tropical areas with dense foliage generally not far from a permanent water One study 
noted the preference of B schlegelii for deep shady Like other Bothriechis members B schlegelii 
is arboreal and has a strong prehensile tail It is largely nocturnal consuming small rodents 
frogs lizards and small It is not known to be an aggressive snake but will 
not hesitate to strike if harassed A typical ambush predator it waits patiently for unsuspecting 
prey to wander by Sometimes it is known to select a specific ambush site and 
return to it every year in time for the spring migration of birds Studies have 
indicated that B schlegeli learns to improve strike accuracy over Sometimes B schlegelii especially juveniles 
will employ what is known as “caudal luring” wiggling the tail in wormlike motions to 
encourage potential prey to move within striking range There is a myth among villagers in 
some small areas of South America that the eyelash viper will wink flashing its "eyelashes" 
at its victim following a venomous strike Snakes are not physiologically capable of such behavior 
as they have no eyelids and can not close their The eyelash viper reaches sexual 
maturity at around two years of age and the ovoviviparous species reproduces throughout the year 
in warm Females carry eggs for around six months before they hatch internally where the 
young complete their Pregnant females have enlarged lower abdomens and may stop eating in later 
stages of In a typical brood they give birth to live young which are in 
length and appear physically similar to Males engage in a sometimes hourslong courtship ritual called 
a "dance of the adders" in which two males posture and intimidate one another in 
an upright "cobralike" stance until one is pushed away or falls to the They are 
polygynous and usually mate at Despite the inherent danger of its venom B schlegelii is 
frequently available in the exotic animal trade and is well represented in zoos worldwide It 
is frequently captive bred for color and pattern Exporting from the wild is not as 
common as it once was but is not unknown In general they make hardy captives 
readily feeding on provided mice Some authoritieswho also recognize a montane form that is treated 
either as a subspecies B s supraciliaris or as a species B Found in the 
province of San José in Costa it was sometimes referred to as the eyelash mountain 
while more recent publications recognizing the species designation refer to it as the blotched Eyelash

Disorder of written expression is a type of learning disability in which a person’s writing 
ability falls substantially below normally expected range based on the individual’s age educational background and 
measured intelligence Poor writing skills must interfere significantly with academic progress or daily activities that 
involves written spelling grammar handwriting punctuation word usage This disorder is also generally concurrent with 
disorders of reading andor mathematics as well as disorders related to behavior Since it is 
so often associated with other learning disorders and mental problems it is uncertain whether it 
can appear by The prevalence of disorder of written expression is estimated to be of 
a similar frequency to other learning disorders between needed A diagnosis can be made based 
on results of several Specific causes of this disorder are unknown The interaction of physical 
psychological and environmental factors is thought to contribute to the disorder of written expression In 
neuropsychological and neurobiological research some studies show evidence that abnormally high testosterone levels and abnormalities 
in cognitive processes visualmotor linguistic attentional and memory are thought to play a role in 
learning disorder cases The impact of brain injuries in both children and adults can impair 
any of these cognitive Although disorder for written expressions skills can be difficult and an 
enduring problem all throughout childhood into adulthood different types of treatment and support can help 
individuals who have this disorder to employ strategies and skills in the home and school 
environment This includes remedial education tailored to improve specific skills providing special academic services in 
the learning environment and addressing concurrent health and mental issues It is sometimes necessary to 
foster motivational techniques to maintain motivation and minimize negative thoughts or feelings Using whatever modifications 
are necessary to overcome fears of failure in the early stages of writing mediation is 
strongly encouraged because children with learning disabilities often experience low selfesteem and confidence which may 
The Maratha Conquest of Northwest India occurred between and Though it was shortlived it had 
longlasting effects upon the politics of the Indian subcontinent After the death of Aurangzeb in 
the Years War ended in Maratha victory This was followed by the phase of rapid 
expansion of the Maratha Empire for the next years under patronage of Shahu and his 
appointed Peshwa Baji Rao I and Senasahensubha Raghuji I Bhonsle They conquered Gujarat the whole 
of Central India and Orissa subdued Rajputana and raided into Bengal and Tiruchirapalli in Tamil 
Nadu and imposed chauth upon these areas Their ambition pushed them further northwards than Delhi 
into Haryana which collided with the ambitions of Ahmad Shah Abdali the founder of Durrani 
Empire In Ahmad Shah Abdali raided Delhi and captured Punjab and Kashmir with the help 
of Rohilla chief Najib Khan He installed his son Timur Shah Durrani in Multan and 
went back to The Maratha Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao sent his brother Raghunath Rao along 
with Shamsher Bahadur Gangadhar Tatya Sakharambapu Naroshankar and Maujiram Bania and a large army towards 
Delhi They were accompanied by Malhar Rao Holkar of Malwa who had a long experience 
of North India and its rulers The Marathas captured Delhi in August They decisively defeated 
the Rohillas and Afghans near Delhi in The defeat was so decisive that Najib Khan 
surrendered to the Marathas and became their In Punjab Adina Beg Khan along with Sikhs 
was already in revolt with Ahmad Shah Abdali who had invaded Punjab multiple times and 
had been repled each time He decided to call Marathas for help On March Raghunathrao 
had encamped at Rajpura where he received Adina Beg Khan’s envoys and was informed that 
the latter accompanied by Sikh fighters belonging to the bands the jathas of Jassa Singh 
Ahluwalia and Baba Ala Singh of Patiala had closed upon Sirhind from the other side 
of Satluj A concerted attack on the fort of Sirhind was made by the Sikhs 
and Marathas on March Ahmad Samad Khan with his Afghan troops held out for about 
two weeks before his capitulation on March After the victory the town was thoroughly sacked 
by the victors After defeating the AfghanRohilla forces the Marathas forced the Afghans into the 
Khyber Adina Beg's sudden death threw Punjab into turmoil Many of his soldiers particularly Afghan 
mercenaries deserted his army camp and added to the number of freebooters thus creating chaos 
and anarchy everywhere Sikhs started again to revolt against Muslim ruling elite which had failed 
to make any permanent settlement with them Khwaja Mirza who was now the Maratha governor 
of Punjab could not cope with the situation He sent an express appeal to the 
Peshwa for reinforcements alerted all the junior Maratha officers to help him restoring law and 
order in the state and recalled Maratha detachments from Peshawar and Attock to safeguard his 
position in Lahore Tukoji Holkar and Narsoji Pandit the Maratha commandants of Attock and Peshawar 
had to withdraw their troops from the frontier posts Sabbaji Patil was now given the 
charge of Raghunathrao and his deputy Malhar Rao were not interested in holding the position 
in the north for long On their request Peshwa had to find their substitutes He 
gave supreme command of Dehli to Dattaji Scindia while Jankoji Scindia was appointed his deputy 
They proceeded towards Delhi separately at different A massive army of Marathas under their new 
commanders Scindias reached Machhiwara in March Like Raghunathrao Dattaji also didn't want to stay in 
Punjab for long As there was no news of Abdali's invasion Dattaji deferred the appointment 
of any permanent governor in Punjab and left it to the Peshwa for decision at 
his convenience After deliberations with his advisors Dattaji deputed Sabbaji to take care of Punjab 
and Nwfp along with assistance of Bapu Rao Dadu Rao and Sena Pandit for time 
being and himself left Punjab for the suppression of NajibudDaula in the Ganga valley Bapu 
Rao took the charge of Rohtas Fort while other officers were appointed on the frontier 
Taking advantage of Sabbaji's absence from Peshawar post the Afghans marched to Peshawar The Peshawar 
fort was taken by Afghans with heavy losses to the besieged Maratha garrison Thereafter the 
Afghan invaders under Jahan Khan overran Attock and threatened the Rohtas Fort By that time 
Sabaji Patil Sabaji Scindia reached the place in the Battle of Lahore with fresh troops 
and a large number of Sikh fighters who had once again allied with Marathas The 
combined forces of Marathas and Sikhs defeated Afghan garrison in which Jahan lost his son 
and was himself wounded The Afghans quickly vacated the forts of Attock and Peshawar and 
retreated west to Afghanistan So Peshawar once again fell to It was unbearable for Abdali 
to overlook this defeat The Rohilla chief Najib Khan invited Abdali to avenge his defeat 
He along with his commander Jahan Khan invaded Punjab for the fifth time with a 
massive force of accompanied by heavy fieldguns Trimbak Rao's strong Maratha garrison of Multan was 
massacred and only of them could cross river Satluj Lahore the capital of Punjab however 
did not fall to the Afghans The remaining Marathas retreated straight to Delhi from their 
northernmost posts at Sonipat On December a battle was fought between Deattaji and Abdali in 
which Dattaji was defeated with a loss of Maratha soldiers As a consequence of victory 
Abdali managed to join forces with Najib defeated and killed Dattaji at Burari Ghat near 
Delhi in January Abdali followed him Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao sent his cousin Sadashivrao Bhau 
to repel Abdali which finally resulted in the Third Battle of Panipat where Abdali decisively 
defeated Panipat debacle was such a blow to the Maratha Empire that it could not 
enter north India for a century and could never really recover from the enormous losses 
they sustained during the whole campaign against the Durrani The Marathas had failed to befriend 
the important party of Punjab particularly Sikhs even though they had not entered Punjab they 
had got close enough to be aided by Sikh troops in numerous battles They couldn't 
make any formal treaty with Sikhs who along with Adina Beg had assisted them in 
their conquest of northwest According to an assessment the Sikhs were ever ready to cooperate 
with the Marathas but it goes to the discredit of the Marathas that they could 
not make a proper confederacy with Sikhs due to their fear of the Sikhs tall 
statures Kirpal Singh Unlike Ahmad Shah Abdali who subsequently raised a cry of jihad the 
Marathas couldn't mobilize their resources and make a common cause with the Sikhs in order 
to pay the Afghan Emperor in his own coin Finding the Maratha leadership completely off 
guard against their political foes many Afghans who were earlier taken captives by Marathas quickly 
changed their loyalty towards Adina Beg and were recruited in his army However later on 
they betrayed him and joined Abdali's forces during his fifth The Peshwa was alarmed by 
the growing French and British influence in the When Abdali invaded Punjab for the fifth 
time the Marathas didn't try hard enough to save the frontier posts and instead started

In computing fragmented objects are truly distributed objects It is a novel design principle extending 
the traditional concept of stub based distribution In contrast to distributed objects they are physically 
distributed and encapsulate the distribution in the object itself Parts of the object named fragments 
may exist on different nodes and provide the object's interface Each client accessing a fragmented 
object by its unique object identity presumes a local fragment Fragmented objects may act like 
a RPCbased infrastructure or a caching smart proxy as well Therefore clients cannot distinguish between 
the access of a local object a local stub or a local fragment Full transparency 
is gained by the following characteristics of fragmented objects Arbitrary protocols may be chosen for 
the internal communication between the fragments For instance this allows to hide realtime protocols eg 
RTP for media streaming behind a standard CORBA interface The internal structure of a fragmented 
object is arranged by the object developerdeployer It may be client–server hierarchical peertopeer and others 
Thus a downward compatibility to stub based distribution is ensured As both the distribution of 
state and functionality are hidden behind the object interface their respective distribution over the fragments 
is also arbitrary In addition an application using a fragmented object can also tolerate a 
change in distributions which is achieved by exchanging the fragment at one or multiple hosts 
This procedure can either be triggered by a user who changes object properties or by 
the fragmented object itself that is the collectivity of its fragments eg when some fragment 
is considered to have failed Of course an exchange request may trigger one or more 
other internal changes The object developer can migrate the state and the functionality over the 
fragments by providing different fragment implementations Those dynamically change the inside the fragmented objects A

The common scalebacked antbird Willisornis poecilinotus is a species of passerine bird in the antbird 
family Thamnophilidae It is found in the Amazon of Bolivia Brazil Colombia Ecuador French Guiana 
Guyana Peru Suriname and Venezuela Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests As with 
other species of antbirds it regularly follows swarms of army ants as they flush insects 
and other arthropods out of the leaf litter The common scalebacked antbird was described and 
illustrated by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in and given the binomial name Hypocnemis The 
specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek poikilonōtos "with variegated back" from poikilos "spotted" and 
nōton It was subsequently included in the genus Hylophylax but was found to not be 
closely related to the other species in the genus and was placed in Willisornis It 
was briefly placed in Dichropogon but this name is preoccupied by a genus of asilid 
flies Dichropogon Bezzi It was formerly considered conspecific with the Xingu scalebacked There are five 
In addition to being sexually dimorphic the plumages of the subspecies are highly variable leading 
to speculations that the common scalebacked antbird as presently defined may include more than a

is a general aviation cargo and state aircraft airport in Istanbul It closed to commercial 
passenger flights on April when all flights were transferred to Istanbul Airport As of April 
the airport is open only for cargo maintenance general aviation air taxis business flights and 
state and diplomatic aircraft while commercial passenger flights are all handled at the newly built 
Istanbul First opened in as a military airfield located on the European side of the 
city it is located of the city centre The airport was originally named Yeşilköy Airport 
In the it was renamed Istanbul Atatürk International Airport in honour of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 
the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey It served more than million 
passengers in making it the airport in the world in terms of total passenger traffic 
and the in the world in terms of international passenger traffic In it was Europe's 
airport after London Heathrow Paris Charles de Gaulle Frankfurt Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport having 
fallen from third place after a decline in passengers due to security Istanbul Atatürk Airport 
was replaced in regards to commercial passenger functions by the newly constructed Istanbul Airport in 
April in order to meet Istanbul's growing domestic and international air traffic demand as a 
source destination and transit point Both airports were used in parallel for five months from 
late with the new airport gradually expanding to serve more domestic and regional On April 
Atatürk's IST IATA airport code was inherited by Istanbul Airport and Atatürk Airport was assigned 
the code ISL after the full transfer of all scheduled passenger activities to the new 
airport was The final commercial flight Turkish Airlines Flight left Atatürk Airport on April at 
for Istanbul Atatürk Airport featured two passenger terminals linked to each The former Domestic Terminal 
is the older and smaller of the two terminals and exclusively handled domestic flights within 
Turkey It featured its own checkin and airside facilities on the upper floor with twelve 
departure gates equipped with jet and five baggage reclaim belts on the ground The former 
International Terminal was inaugurated in and used for all international flights It featured a large 
main hall containing eight checkin isles and a wide range of airside facilities such as 
shops and restaurant gates equipped with jetbridges and busboarding stands The arrivals floor had baggage 
reclaim In addition there is a general aviation Terminal to the northwest of the passenger

Monster Maze is a computer game developed from an idea by JK Greye and programmed 
by Malcolm Evans in for the Sinclair platform with the memory expansion The game was 
initially released by J K Greye Software in and rereleased later the same year by 
Evans' own startup New Generation Software Rendered using lowresolution character block "graphics" it was one 
of the first games for a home and one of the first games incorporating typical 
elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror Monster Maze puts the 
player in a maze with one exit and a hostile monster the Tyrannosaurus rex There 
the player must traverse the maze from the firstperson perspective and escape through the exit 
without being eaten JKGreye Software went on to become a very successful games company publishing 
Games Tapes for the Sinclair in Monster Maze Defender both designed by JKGreye and programmed 
by Malcolm Evans New Generation Software went on to become a wellknown software firm with 
the Sinclair platform and continued to pioneer the gaming technology for and the later model 
Sinclair ZX Spectrum The press immediately gave the game a title of a "firm favourite" 
of the users Decades later it became popular with the retrogaming community inspiring remakes and 
fuelling emulation The game uses an cell maze which is randomly Initially the T rex lies 
in wait Once the player starts moving the beast begins hunting Thereafter the T rex may 
either calm down if the player goes into a part of the maze that is 
far enough away or become more active as the player comes closer If the T rex 
gets a direct view of its prey the monster will run directly at the The 
T rex anxiety level reported to the player as a statement in the status line provides 
an indirect clue to the player's relative distance from the monster These statements are REX 
LIES IN WAIT followed by HE IS HUNTING FOR YOU FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING REX HAS SEEN 
YOU and RUN HE IS BESIDE YOU or RUN HE IS BEHIND YOU The player's 
speed is greater than the monster's thus it is possible to escape by running unless 
the player is trapped in a dead The player can manually map the maze on 
a piece of paper with each step but this becomes increasingly difficult as the pace 
increases The fast pace can also lead to hard keyboard presses which in turn can 
shake the memory expansion connection and lead to a sudden reset with several minutes worth 
reload Points are awarded for each step made by the player any time the dinosaur 
is on an active hunt Since the player runs faster than the monster it is 
possible to accumulate points by running around in circles with the monster just a few 
steps behind Points are also given upon successfully getting away through an exit and into 
another When the game ends the player is informed about being "sentenced to roam the 
maze forever" and then can either "appeal" or continue playing again in the last maze 
If the appeal is attempted it is rejected with probability in which case the player 
is sent back to roam the previous maze again An appeal which is accepted effectively 
results in the computer selfreset via BASIC's NEW Monster Maze was the first game programmed 
by Malcolm Evans based on a design by He worked in the aerospace industry first 
in aircraft design and then as a microprocessor scientist at Sperry Gyroscope at Bristol United 
Kingdom He received a from his wife for his thirtyseventh birthday in Malcolm developed basic 
aspects of the game to test what the computer was capable of and completed it 
after adding design features suggested by JKGreye including adding the TRex and turning the Maze 
into a game Friends persuaded Malcolm that the game was of high enough quality to 
sell and it was eventually released by JK Greye Software in February When soon after that 
the Bristol branch of Sperry Gyroscope closed Malcolm made a decision to concentrate fully on 
computer gaming The firm New Generation Software he had founded kept producing games for the 
Sinclair Research computers and became synonymous with gaming on this platform for some Some of 
his games were hailed by the gaming scene but some titles occasionally drew criticism from 
reviewers for their fancy graphics but poor game plot After releasing Defender and Breakout for 
the Malcolm switched the development efforts from to ZX Spectrum as the latter model hit 
the market In addition to republishing the Monster Maze the new firm also released such 
game titles as Escape Tunnel Knot in Corridors of Genon Trashman and Travel with Trashman 
Light Magic Jonah Barrington's Squash The Custard Kid and Cliff The game was sold domestically 
in the UK and overseas and became a hit shortly after it was released when 
the had just been launched software standards were generally pretty low One exception to this 
rule was a program called Monster Maze which has been a firm favourite with owners 
since it first appeared Contemporary reviews described it as "the best game I have seen 
for the Sinclair and "Brilliant brilliant brilliant Straight away this gets into my personal top 
ten ZX Programs Undoubtedly one of the best ZX programs Even though it did not 
use the undocumented hires graphics feature of the and rendered the scene with pseudographics characters 
available in the standard character set the game was considered to be a remarkable achievement 
utilising the machine's capabilities to its best If I had to choose just one programme 
to impress an audience with the capabilities of the then Monster Maze would be the 
one without a doubt Soon the Sinclair platform users began switching over to the newer 
ZX Spectrum which had better graphics resolution and colour bigger RAM and ROM as well 
as sound capability and a sleeker look and feel Some people still continued to use 
their and even the Spectrum users gave credit to Monster Maze as the game that 
brought the aspect into the home computer gaming Even those critics who dismissed the as 
a child's toy had to admit that the program was innovative and wellpresented Monster Maze 
marked the rise of the use of techniques on microcomputers as small as the and 
Spectrum Monster Maze's praises brought recognition to Malcolm Evans and his firm New Generation Software 
which continued releasing further games that further improved the gaming experience Even when later hit 
games by NGS such as Trashman were covered by the gaming media reviews Monster Maze 
was remembered as the landmark impressive start From the outset New Generation and Malcolm Evans 
have become synonymous with graphics Edge in stated that Monster Maze "is the original survival 
horror game" writing "Ask any player and they’ll tell you what Monster Maze was chiefly 
about fear panic terror and facing an implacable relentless foe who’s going to get you 
in the Retro Gamer agreed in stating that "Survival horror may have been a phrase 
first coined by Resident Evil but it could’ve easily applied to Malcolm Evans’ massive With 
games played mostly in emulated environments by the retrogaming community it still fetches enthusiastic reviews

immersion into a firstperson game Best of the old games we played this month The 
best thing about was strangely the silence as you moved around This added to the 
atmosphere This also added to the scares There was nothing worse than heading down a 
corridor and in the distance seeing the start of the dino heading towards you Because 
the graphics were slow to draw the dino came at you in a few steps 
Turning around and sprinting the other way was a manic dance across the keyboard while 
you looked stunned as the screen filled with teeth It was truly a pants wetting 
moment The graphical view animated in real time at around per second is composed of 
pixel blackandwhite characters so the view is roughly square taking a area on the text 
screen Subcharacter resolution of the pseudographics character set makes the resolution doubled in each dimension 
making the view consist of "larger pixels" Using the with a dithering pattern also made 
it possible for the game author to incorporate a third colour grey in the blackandwhite 
picture Part of the screen is reserved for the score count and a oneline status

who—like all the other officers—was white A proclamation by Confederate President Jefferson Davis had indicated 
that members of the regiment would not be treated as prisoners of war if taken 
in battle The enlisted men were to be delivered to state authorities to be auctioned 
off or otherwise treated as runaway slaves while the white officers were to be Colonel 
Higginson wrote "We their officers did not go there to teach lessons but to receive 
them There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met 
more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred 
in all their lives” The regiment was particularly effective at conducting raids along the coast 
of Florida and Georgia due to their familiarity with the The regiment was a step 
in the evolution of Union thinking towards the escaped slaves who crossed their lines Initially 
they were returned to their owners Next they were considered contraband and employed as laborers 
Finally the legal fiction that they were property was abandoned and they were allowed to 
enlist in the Army although in segregated units commanded by white officers Harriet Tubman served 
with these men as a cook nurse spy and scout Susie King Taylor whose husband 
and other relatives fought with the regiment also served as a laundress and nurse for 
the men from August until mustering out on February As a holdover from the "contraband" 
days black privates were paid per month the rate for laborers rather than the paid 
to white privates The men served as the precedent for the over "colored" troops who 
followed them into the Union Army Col Higginson a minister author and abolitionist documented the 
Gullah dialect spoken by the men and made a record of the spirituals that they

Children's Mercy Park is a soccerspecific stadium in Kansas City Kansas United States and is 
the home of Sporting Kansas City The stadium is located near Kansas Speedway on the 
far west side of Wyandotte County near the Johnson County and Leavenworth County Kansas borders

team for national signing day ceremonies Originally Sporting Club the team's ownership group planned to 
move to southeast Kansas City Missouri on land previously occupied by Bannister Mall The redevelopment 
plan called The Trails was passed on December The last package of economic incentives a 
tax rebate was passed on November The stadium's planned site had been demolished to prepare 
the site for infrastructure It was intended to open in with a capacity of seats 
However fallout from the financial crisis placed the project on hiatus and the stadium developer 
eventually sought to move the new project near the Village West retail center in Kansas 
City Kansas near the Kansas Speedway and CommunityAmerica The developer of The Trails complex sought 
additional "enhancements" ie borrowing authority from Kansas City Missouri to finance the building of the 
soccer stadium and its associated amateur soccer complex However the city was unwilling to provide 
the desired financing leading the developer to seek a new site across the state linecitation 
needed In September the developer asked Wyandotte County and Kansas state officials for permission to 
use revenues from existing tax increment financing in the Village West area to help finance 
the soccer On December Sporting KC president Robb Heineman provided an update on the stadium

The Domination of the Draka also called the Draka series or the Draka saga is 
an alternate history series generally regarded as dystopian by American author S M Stirling It 
comprises a main trilogy of novels as well as one crossover novel set after the 
original and a book of short stories The series focuses on Draka later The Domination 
a totalitarian expansionist nation founded in South Africa by British settlers in the century where 
cruel slavery plays an increasingly central role In Stirling edited Drakas a collection of short 
stories by other authors who develop plots based on the Domination premise An omnibus edition 
of the Draka Saga was published in containing the first trilogy "Marching Through Georgia" "Under 
the Yoke" and "The Stone Dogs" The world of the Domination diverges from our world 
at the time of the American Revolutionary War when the Netherlands declares war on Great 
Britain resulting in the loss of its Cape Colony to the British After defeat in 
the Revolutionary War the Loyalists who historically went to Canada are instead resettled in the 
new Crown Colony of Drakia named after Sir Francis Drake in South Africa taking their 
slaves with them Thousands of Hessian German mercenaries who fought on the Loyalist side are 
also paid off with land grants in the new colony The Crown Colony of Drakia 
later the Dominion of the Draka is an aggressive militaristic slaveowning society massively influenced by 
the attitudes of these American slave owner settlers that are allowed to run unchecked reinforced 
over the course of the late and century by Icelanders fleeing their island after the 
volcanic devastation French royalists defeated American Confederates and other reactionary refugees also emigrate to the 
colony The much earlier Dutch Boer settlers are completely assimilated by these subsequent immigrants The 
genealogical lineage of both the original Boer and Southern Loyalist settlers from the late century 
and respectively is almost overwhelmingly made up of AngloSaxons Nordic Germanics and Celtics although these 
immigrant groups also include the scattered descendants of French Protestant Huguenots fleeing persecution in Roman 
Catholic France and later the aforementioned French aristocrats seeking sanctuary from the French Revolution Although 
most Draka remain at least nominally Christian for several generations by the the practice of 
Christianity among them has declined to the point that the few remaining Christian Citizens are 
subject to scrutiny by the Security Directorate and unofficially prevented from attaining officer ranks in 
the military The Draka capital city is Archona on the site of our own world's 
Pretoria The uppermost strata of Draka society by the century was composed of the hereditary 
plantation families the "old Domination" aristocracy descended from Loyalists that fled America who monopolized landholding 
early on Over time a new prosperous technocratic subclass emerged below this one as the 
Domination industrialized though it was still just "emerging" even as late as the Eurasian War 
as the Domination was inclined to rely on slave labor more than industrialization The Dutch 
Boer population actually did manage to survive as a distinct Draka subclass after a fashion 
discontent with being edged out of landholding by the vastly more numerous Loyalist immigrants Dutch 
Boer families came to dominate the officer pool of the Draka Navy By the Eurasian 
War of course the Draka Navy was still disproportionately very small due to their heavy 
reliance upon land warfare which made it both easier for the entire institution to be 
dominated by a handful of Dutch Boer families and at the same time guaranteed that 
it would always be a minority power in wider Draka politics The Confederates who immigrated 
after defeat in the American Civil War arrived too late to join the landholding class 
or the industrialist class and the Dutch Boers already had a firm control on the 
Navy Instead as this coincided with a great outburst of Draka expansion the Confederate immigrant 
families filled the rapidly expanding Security Directorate secret police Paralleling how the Navy was dominated 
by Dutch Boers by the Eurasian War the Security Directorate was dominated by Confederatedescended hereditary 
families who wielded considerable influence in militarized Draka society Citizens who are free and can 
vote comprise only a small fraction of the Domination's population Over of the population are 
slaves When the United Kingdom and most of the British Empire abolish slavery during the 
the Draka avoided emancipation by labeling their slaves "serfs" At first serfs are officially debt 
laborers who can earn their freedom but this is a feeble legal fiction This pretense 
is dropped when the Draka withdraw from the Empire but the word "serf" remains the 
standard term Serfs have no rights and are not allowed to handle money Their testimony 
is inadmissible in any court Any child born to a serf mother is a serf 
Sex between a male serf and a female Draka is a capital offense for both 
parties At first serfs are all African blacks and Draka citizenship is open to all 
whites although Nordic Anglo Saxon and Celtic types are especially welcomed Because Draka expansion is 
based solely on enslaving conquered peoples they soon have serfs from other races including whites 
As Draka social mores diverge more and more from those of free societies and the 
Draka are more and more widely hated they evolve an ideology in which they are 
"The Race" — the natural overlords of all humanity Those nonDraka not already enslaved are 
"feral serfs" who represent a permanent threat to the survival of the Draka Thus the 
Draka are dedicated to enslaving all humanity since the only alternative is the extinction of 
The Race Almost all Draka citizens own at least a few slaves The Draka are 
heavily outnumbered meaning that a slave rebellion is a constant threat In response the Draka 
are utterly ruthless in their discipline of serfs Impalement is the favored Draka method of 
executing rebellious serfs Nonetheless many Draka especially those who are central characters in the novels 
aim to create an idealized "rural community under a lord" feel on their lands Most 
Draka are quite fond of several of their serfs as a European or American might 
have a favorite horse Such an idealistic image is often spoiled however when punishment — 
always severe — has to be enacted Killing a serf is never a crime though 
it is a possible tort when the serf is the property of another Draka The 
citizen Draka army is made up of shock troops meant to be used as the 
arm of decision in maneuver warfare These Citizen troops are to a man and woman 
superb physical specimens unbelievably strong with startling muscle definition astonishing stamina and reactions and are 
the equal of several elite enemy soldiers due to their fanatical and relentless dedication to 
fitness physical conditioning endless combat training and diet Draka men and women are trained for 
combat from their infancy Free Draka troops can be disciplined by superior officers for neglecting 
to keep their physiques and fitness sharply honed to the highest possible standard although this 
would be extremely rare as poor physical conditioning would be seen as an affront to 
one's family and reputation Their physical regimen is expected to be maintained in times of 
relative peace as the Draka are almost always on a permanent war footing For attritional 
warfare the Domination uses Janissary slave soldiers who make up of the Draka army These 
troops are also quite formidable and are probably on a par with regular Alliance combatants 
although they are less well armed or equipped than their Draka masters or enemy troops 
Draka soldiers neither ask nor give quarter—all captured enemies are killed permanently enslaved or on 
very rare occasions used as hostages to trade for serfs and Janissaries captured by the 
enemy or Citizen troops who for some reason have been unable to take their own 
lives to avoid capture perhaps through injury because Draka are never willingly captured alive Several 
of the books' characters however do pay professional if not personal respect from time to 
time to the bravery skill and tenacity of enemy troops they encounter and if the 
enemy's equipment doesn't always impress the Draka occasionally acknowledge their good use of it In 
the books Draka equipment from tanks to tankbusting aircraft seems deliberately evocative of century military 
equipment enhancing the otherworldliness and superiority of the Draka in technological as well as purely 
physical sense The assault rifles used by Draka citizensoldiers feature integral bipods and optical sights 
while support weaponry includes nerve gas grenades and magazinefed mortars Descriptions of the Draka Hond 
tanks evoke images of modern tanks such as the Abrams In a similar vein flashbacks 
involving some of the older characters reveal that the Draka had a large dirigible air 
force capable of strategic bombing during the First World War From Under the Yoke onwards 
Draka equipment takes an even more sciencefiction turn Genetically modified baboon shock troops containing the 
DNA of certain species of dogs and humans as well combat spacecraft and paininducing irremovable 
bracelets for troublesome slaves make appearances While in The Stone Dogs the Protracted Struggle is 
still primarily a Cold Waresque arms race of nuclear capability modified geneticallytargeted diseases and advanced 
computer viruses also make an appearance Being focused on land conquests the Domination always had 
a disproportionately small navy even through the Eurasian War World War II The budget for 
the coastal patrol and brownwater naval units maintained by the Security Directorate during the Eurasian 
War was actually greater than the combined budget of the entire bluewater Draka Navy An 
attempted amphibious invasion of Spain during the Eurasian War was left stalled at its beachheads 
a rare moment in which the Drakas fell short of complete success After the Eurasian 
War however with increasing reliance upon air power and spaceflight this became an increasingly moot 
point Commanding ranks in Citizen's Force where free citizens serve A fullstrength legion has about 
citizens and about serf auxiliaries who are unarmed support personnel in noncombatant functions The Janissary 
units are commanded by citizen officers and for the serf soldiers use the traditional ranks 
from Private to Master Sergeant the highest rank available to subject race personnel During the 
the Draka trade extensively with India Ceylon is an early conquest which leads to a 
fad for Mughal artwork Some new Draka cities are also given Indianstyle names including Diskarapur 
Newcastle and Shahnapur Maputo From early in the nineteenth century the Draka develop a craze 
for Classical Antiquity and draw from it much of their military and political terminology It 
is explained that during the early and rapid conquest of Egypt in Draka scouts stumbled 
upon a long lost treasure trove of all the lost works of the GrecoRoman world 
which sparked off this fixation Antiquity provides the Draka with a readymade model of "colourblind 
slavery" The ancient Greeks and Romans saw no problem in enslaving people of the same 
skin colour as themselves and even of the same language and culture though with them 
unlike the Draka the wholesale enslavement of a defeated enemy was the exception rather than 
the rule and their slaves could and frequently did gain manumission see Slavery in antiquity 
Their core population being primarily composed of Loyalists who fled from the American Revolution and 
officially being a British colony for many decades the Draka speak English but with a 
very odd accent which it is difficult for nonDraka spies to imitate perfectly Some attempt 
is made to transcribe the Draka accent phonetically in books though it is stated that 
these are only rough approximations It is described as generally sounding like a Southern United 
States drawl mixed with an undertone of guttural Germanic sounds from Afrikaans given that the 
original core population were Loyalist families that fled the American revolution to South Africa which 
then received large immigrant waves from the defeated Confederate States of America and losing sides 
from the German revolutions in Europe The Draka enforce their English dialect on subject peoples 
and gradually outlaw conquered peoples from speaking their native languages Dozens of major languages across 
Africa and Eurasia are rendered extinct as a result along with hundreds of minor ones 
Localized accents persist up to a point among certain conquered peoples ie those conquered in 
the last three generations or so but their overall goal is to enforce linguistic uniformity 
The Dominion draws substantially from the ideology of Friedrich Nietzsche and similar philosophers and can 
be viewed as an "AntiAmerica" in the sense that like the United States the Draka 
nation started off as a British settler colony but evolved along diametrically opposite lines While 
the United States had slavery even slaveholders had to nominally adhere to the American values 
of liberty and equality and the contradiction was eventually resolved by the American Civil War 
The Draka on the other hand view themselves as a master race and unlike the 
Nazis who believed that their mere racial heritage made them superior are keenly aware of 
the effort they must make to maintain this status; in the manner of ancient Sparta 
all Draka citizen children attend sexsegregated boarding schools with an extreme emphasis on military prowess 
and physical conditioning While the United States in the century set for itself the goal 
of equality for all regardless of race the Draka worked to enslave all nonDraka humans 
also regardless of race Politically the Draka state is described as 'aristocratic republic' with a 
parliamentary system of government The Archon is the head of state appointed for a term 
by a parliament elected in free and fair elections Draka citizens have a considerable degree 
of free speech but fundamental criticism of the slave system is forbidden The Draka economy 
is heavily dominated by cartels known as Combines with ownership split between the state and 
the Landholders' League citizens can only own the right to use land not the land 
itself which can be confiscated in the event of neglect or misuse There is also 
a considerable smallbusiness private sector The Draka economy is on the gold standard with the 
basic unit of currency being the Auric In the third novel with gold becoming plentiful 
due to imports from space the Draka switch to the Auric reflecting a basket of 
commodities The Draka take over Egypt and Ceylon from the French during the Napoleonic Wars 
and over the course of the century the Draka gradually conquer and enslave all of 
Africa The last areas to be conquered were the jungles of the Congo due to 
the danger of tropical diseases Technological development is faster than in our own history as 
the Draka put the wealth derived from their vast gold and diamond deposits to effective 
use by offering large grants to scientists and inventors who settle in their territory and 
develop new inventions These include Richard Trevithick inventor of the steam locomotive who settles in 
Virconium equivalent to our own world's Durban in R J Gatling who settles in Diskarapur 
in and Louis Pasteur who discovers malaria's mosquito vector in the while working for the 
Shahnapur Institute of Tropical Medicine The United States is also much more expansionistic than in 
our own timeline – it annexes Canada after the War of a conquest presumably made 
easier in this timeline by the absence of Loyalist American settlers to enlarge the Canadian 
population and Mexico after the Mexican–American War since it is implied the addition of numerous 
Northern FreeSoil states following the conquest of Canada strengthened Southern demands for a reciprocal campaign 
to increase the number of slaveholding states with representation in Congress William Walker's Southern adventurers 
conquer Central America; while Cuba Hispaniola Hawaii and the Philippines are annexed in During the 
American Civil War the Draka supply massive amounts of aid to the Confederacy including steampowered 
armored cars However the Union still wins the Civil War with the help of large 
numbers of Mexican conscripts and annexes Walker's Central American empire Cuba Hispaniola Hawaii and the 
Philippines are granted statehood in with the Central American territories following later The United States 
eventually has states in total The Empire of Brazil seizes control of Bolivia Paraguay Uruguay 
and the Guyanas in the the same decade which sees the United Kingdom uniting Australia 
and New Zealand as the Dominion of Australasia In addition the Republic of Gran Colombia 
never breaks up into the nations of Colombia Venezuela and Ecuador as in our world 
This exemplifies the trend in the series of fewer and fewer nations achieving sovereign independent 
status In China the Taiping Rebellion is successful resulting in a China which is even 
more incapable of successful modernization than in our own history The Japanese victory in the 
First SinoJapanese War which in the Draka timeline occurs in is even more decisive with 
Japan not only annexing Formosa but also Korea Hainan and several Chinese coastal cities After 
victory in the RussoJapanese War Japan annexes Manchuria and establishes a protectorate over the weak 
Taiping Dynasty The Dominion of Draka joins the Allied side in the Great War and 
conquers the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria It subsequently declares its independence from United Kingdom and 
renames itself the Domination of the Draka The Domination of Draka then takes advantage of 
the Russian Civil War and seizes the rest of the Middle East much of Central 
Asia and China west of Xian and Wuhan Up to Janissaries die in pacification campaigns 
during this time in the Domination's new territories Sixtyfive percent of the population of Afghanistan 
is exterminated in retaliation for the fierce resistance of that nation's "Badmash" rebels In the 
Empire of Japan deposes the Taiping Emperor and annexes all Chinese territory not in Draka 
hands After the death of Vladimir Lenin a second civil war further weakened the Soviet 
Union which is won by a faction led by Joseph Stalin—who subsequently orders a "hermit 
kingdom" isolationist policy Under the influence of Draka philosophers such as Elvira Naldorssen the traditional 
Draka white supremacism is replaced by Drakasupremacism with the Draka viewing all of nonDrakan humanity 
as their cattle Naldorssen explains the ideology of the Domination the utter amorality of which 
will lead enemies of the Draka to refer to them as 'Snakes' The first book 
of the series Marching Through Georgia is a war story set during the Eurasian War 
the Domination timeline's equivalent of World War II In this war the Nazis utterly crushed 
the Soviet Union with only a Siberian rump state beyond the Urals surviving under a 
junta led by Marshal Timoshenko The Nazi success derives from the Soviets suffering two recent 
devastating civil wars and needing to defend a long southern border with the Domination Additionally 
the LendLease between the United States and the Soviets was rendered ineffective by Nazi Uboats 
effecting a powerful blockade in the Atlantic Japanese naval hegemony in the Pacific and the 
Domination's refusal to allow lendlease supplies through its territory The Domination entered the war just 
before the Nazi invasion of Russia and conquered Italy with the Nazis' tacit consent The 
Draka then attacked the Third Reich in the Caucasus region attempting to cut off a 
large part of the German army The German Wehrmacht is somewhat more advanced than historically 
with a fully mechanized supply train The WaffenSS units facing the Draka Citizen Airborne unit 
the novel centers around are also in possession of numerous 'hybrid' armoured vehicles made from 
German and captured Soviet parts but they are still no match for the Draka army 
The Draka citizen soldiers female as well as male are honed killing machines each equal 
to several of their enemy on the battlefield The Draka also have superb weaponry including 
Hond III tanks with armor engine size and gun caliber approaching those of modern MBTs 
and powerful air force which includes highperformance single and twin piston engine fighters airborne early 
warning systems mounted on dirigibles and a twinengine armored ground attack aircraft By all sides 
are widely using nerve gas jet and rocketpowered fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles The United 
States is forced into the war when the entire Pacific Fleet is wiped out at 
Pearl Harbor Japanese forces occupy the US states of Hawaii the Philippines and the Panama 
Canal Zone Additionally Japan occupies northern Australia raids California and the Imperial Japanese Navy shells 
Acapulco Consequently the United States cannot open a second front in Europe Alliance with the 
Nazis against the Draka is also impossible due to the influence of the Jewish lobby 
and a Draka threat to supply Japan with nuclear weaponsrelated materials in the event of 
USGerman peace In the Alliance for Democracy is formed—comprising the military alliance free trade area 
and monetary union This Alliance includes the Americas the United Kingdom India and unoccupied Australia 
The United States turned the tide against Japan with victory in the Battle of the 
Sea of Cortez in which jet fighterbombers armed with guided bombs played a crucial role 
Hawaii was liberated in late and half of the surviving Imperial Japanese Navy was destroyed 
in a nuclear cruise missile attack on the Truk naval base In late Tokyo was 
destroyed by a nuclear cruise missile—killing over people including the Imperial Family A fanatical military 
government takes over Japan The Draka overrun Europe as far as the Pyrenees with the 
decisive blow made with five atomic bombs against the industrial areas of the Ruhr Adolf 
Hitler himself it is revealed in later flashbacks was assassinated by a cadre of generals 
in Without his meddling the German Wehrmacht puts up much more stubborn and effective resistance 
than it did historically against the Soviet Union but the memory of Hitler means that 
the rest of Europe is loath to unite behind the Germans to halt the Draka 
Numerous Draka characters credit Hitler's memory as a key factor in ensuring Draka victory in 
Europe In the Draka completed its conquest of Europe by using its remaining stockpile of 
atomic bombs to force the Pyrenees—finally defeating a communist Spain following a different outcome to 
reality's Spanish Civil War The United Kingdom remained free and was inundated with refugees The 
Draka then turned its attention to the Far East attacking Japaneseoccupied China Despite the rapid 
Draka conquest of Eastern China and Korea the loss of the remaining Japanese naval units 
in the Battle of the Philippines the nuclear destruction of Osaka and the Alliance invasion 
of Kyushu Japan continues a bitter resistance only surrendering to the Alliance in July in 
fear of a Draka invasion of the Home Islands The Eurasian War claimed some million 
lives over three times the death toll of our own World War II The liberated 
SouthEast Asian Federation and Indochinese Republic become members of the Alliance for Democracy as does 
a reconstructed Japan in The United Kingdom minus the Channel Islands is the only remaining 
free nation left in Europe and is heavily defended and fortified against potential Draka attack 
The Domination and the Alliance thus control the entire world between them The second book 
Under the Yoke shows Europe under Draka rule The Draka ruthlessly crush all resistance in 
Europe European institutions are remorselessly removed obliterated and forbidden although religions albeit heavily modified by 
the Draka overlords are tolerated as means of further controlling the enserfed population Schools universities 
and all seats of learning are similarly eradicated Any serfs caught in possession of radios 
or literature are summarily executed Languages are encouraged to die out except for a few 
remaining mutually unintelligible local dialects and are replaced amongst serfs by the slurred Drakan version 
of English Finland is almost completely depopulated and in when a rebellion takes over the 
city of Barcelona the Draka respond with a thermonuclear bomb Under the Yoke contains a 
deliberately horrific description of the impalement of several French Maquis guerrilla soldiers disgusting even the 
Draka who ordered it who nevertheless considers it a necessary means of impressing upon the 
slaves that resistance is futile Thus they will obey more willingly making it possible for 
the Draka to be less harsh giving rise to even further willingness to obey The 
Draka have been slavemasters for two hundred years and have applied modern science to the 
problem of breaking human wills; they are extremely good at it Indeed this feeds further 
into their ideology of the Draka as a master race with individuals capable of enforcing 
their will over many serfs with no other tool than raw willpower In this book 
mention is made from both the conquered peoples and the Draka themselves of the Western 
Allies refusal to join forces with Nazi Germany even though Adolf Hitler was dead by 
late officially by heart attack but in reality assassinated by German Military Intelligence to fight 
the Draka once the full horror of the Drakan onslaught's threat to European civilisation is 
apparent Widespread disgust and revulsion at Germany's genocidal policies towards political ideological and racial enemies 
and utter hatred by former occupied countries are cited as the cause of this reluctance 
even though the Draka treatment to defeated enemies is by that stage universally known Both 
Nazi Germany and the Allies foolishly thought they could defeat the Draka without uniting The 
third book The Stone Dogs tells the story of the Protracted Struggle—the Cold War between 
the Domination of the Draka and the Alliance for Democracy There is a far more 
intense space race in this world with nuclear pulsedrive interplanetary spaceships and colonies and military 
bases established on the Moon on Mars and in the asteroid belt Over a period 
of several decades the Alliance secretly constructs an antimatterdriven starship for transporting people to Alpha 
Centauri in the event of a Draka victory The Draka employ the policy of "No 
peace beyond Luna" leading to frequent skirmishes in the inner solar system It is not 
unknown although extremely rare for people from the Domination to defect to the Alliance Citizens 
primarily seek asylum due to personal convictions while serfs simply want to escape their bondage 
Any citizen or serf caught attempting to defect would be summarily executed though the serf 
would no doubt meet a more hideous death probably by impalement or breaking on the 
wheel These defectors prove valuable to the OSS because of the unique opportunity it offers 
regarding gathering vital information on Drakan society the Drakan dialect which is notoriously difficult to 
acquire and master and the Drakan fighting style which is unmatched anywhere in the Alliance 
In the there is a major setback for the Free World An OSS covert operation 
designed to discredit a Hindu nationalist party and keep India in the Alliance backfires as 
a suicide note is found implicating the OSS in the scandal As a result India 
secedes from the Alliance—and is conquered and enslaved by the Draka within weeks except Burma 
which counterseceded back to the Alliance After the 'Indian Incident' the Alliance for Democracy is 
formally converted into a single superstate The much larger free population of the Alliance gives 
it an edge in physics and computer technology while the Domination gains the upper hand 
in the biological sciences allowing them to perfect their genetic engineering techniques by using their 
slave population as test subjects They finish the Human Genome Project and are performing significant 
genetic alteration on mammalian organisms including humans by the Both sides develop superweapons with which 
to launch the first strike of the inevitable final war However both sides recognize that 
the longterm trends are in the Alliance's favor Due to its much larger economy and 
free population the Alliance's lead in overall scientific progress slowly grows with the stagnant Draka 
increasingly dependent on espionage and Alliance defectors for new innovations The war finally breaks out 
in when the Draka about to lose the secrecy of their superweapon decide to use 
it preemptively instead Draka advantages in bioscience allowed it to create a biopsychological virus "The 
Stone Dogs" This virus lies dormant but causes the host to go violently insane when 
activated by precisely modulated very long wavelength radio waves The Alliance counterpart a computer virus 
designed to trigger selfdestruct mechanisms in Draka military units that go to war footing works 
well but is not as effective at disabling the enemy command and control or crippling 
their space forces Due to the Stone Dogs virus Draka forces ultimately succeed—if barely—in wiping 
out all significant Alliance populations and military forces in the EarthLuna sphere In the process 
they lose percent of the Citizen population and percent of the serf million total The 
Alliance though suffering million casualties and losing its Ceres command center wins in transLunar space 
including the Belt A truce is declared allowing the Alliance remnants in the Belt to 
launch the starship while giving other Alliance remnants in space limited Draka citizenship the new 
Draka will not be able to vote though their children will be The war itself 
proves to be devastating to Earth Though the Solar System belongs to the Draka the 
planet's ecosystems were pushed nearly to the breaking point The war causes a nuclear winter 
lasting for several years a climatic disturbance so severe that ice forms in the Adriatic 
Sea despite most nukes being 'clean' fusion weapons and Archon Eric von Shrakenberg in an 
effort to limit damage to the planet ordering no more nuclear weapons used within the 
atmosphere after a certain point in the conflict At some intervening period before the next 
book in the series the Draka produce a genetically altered new serf race Homo servus 
which is incapable of rebelling This is accomplished by making servus vulnerable to dominance and 
sexual arousal pheromones as well as changing their genetic temperaments toward the emotional and nonaggressive 
Thus they can dispense with the brutal repression needed earlier and entrust serfs with sensitive 
positions such as theoretical physics Because of additional chromosomes added to the drakensis genome drakensis 
and servus cannot interbreed precluding any "half breed" versions of the drakensis "Master Race" A 
'paravirus' is mentioned as the method of converting Homo sapiens serfs to Homo servus the 
sex cells being transformed with the result that infected human parents give birth to servus 
children However it is not clear that this advanced method was the one used for 
the initial changes to human serfs in the early century Of Homo sapiens only a 
few scattered "feral humans" survive precariously on Earth mainly in North America having been quite 
literally bombed back into the Stone Age nearly wiped out with "biobombs" and being hunted 
"for sport" by the Draka The Pygmies of Central Africa are also allowed to survive 
on special lands reserved for their use Drakon takes place in an alternate universe version 
of our It begins in the year aka FS or the Year of the Final 
Society of the Draka history The Domination is pitted against the postAmerican world of Samothrace 
in the Alpha Centauri system which is a colony of Alliance refugees from the Final 
War A failed experiment intended to research wormholes called "moleholes" for FTL travel causes a 
single Drakensis the geneticallyengineered posthuman species of Draka Gwendolyn Ingolfsson to be sent to the 
of an alternate universe very similar to our own The only notable difference is that 
Kenneth Branagh played ObiWan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel though his casting occurs after 
Ingolfsson's incursion in indicating that the introduction of "holoprojectors" by IngolfTech might have attracted a 
higherquality lead in the film of our universe The Samothracians send one of their own 
agents cyborg soldier Kenneth Lafarge to stop her Lefarge arrives in the alternate due to 
the crude nature of the time travel technology Both Lefarge and Ingolfsson create organizations of 
native humans to aid their fight against each other Lefarge's team being led by NYPD 
Detective Henry Caramaggio Both Lefarge and Ingolfsson are killed in an epic battle in New 
York City when the Drakensis attempts to activate a beacon to allow the Draka scientists 
of FS several years having elapsed to lock a transit wormhole to the alternate In 
the time between and in the Domination's home timeline the Samothracians attack the Domination's Earth 
via a series of wormholes laid between Alpha Centauri and Sol These attacks ultimately did 
not succeed however the Draka barely managed to beat back the assault The Alliance colony 
on Samothrace still enjoyed the societal advantages its faction had during the original Protracted Struggle 
ie that as a free society their rate of scientific progress and discovery is much 
faster than the stagnant totalitarian slavemasters of the Draka Given four centuries the scant colonists 
on Samothrace were able to establish a new industrial base on a virgin planet and 
design better weapons than the Draka to the point that their assault first assault nearly 
succeeded in taking back Earth Thanks to perfectly faked documents provided by Lefarge Ingolfsson's estates 
laboratories and archives of advanced technologies fall into Caramaggio's hands who according to the frame 
story of The Domination becomes "the richest man in the world" within twenty years Caramaggio 
releases Ingolfsson's technologies at a rapid rate attempting to prepare his Earth for another Draka 
attack Since unknown to Caramaggio Ingolfsson transferred her knowledge into her infant daughter the struggle 
will no doubt resume at some point The series has been criticized on various places 
on the internet for giving the Draka an impossibly fastspreading and technologically advancing society as 
well as for assuming that the British would have tolerated the Draka's harsh slavery When 
asked about these attacks on the implausibility of the series in an interview Stirling answered 
There's a small internet industry of 'proving' that the Domination couldn't happen I consider this 
a complement sic How many people go on at great length trying to prove that 
vampires and werewolves don't Stirling's use of the Draka as pointofview characters has led to 
accusations that he has some sympathy with them for example in his entry in The 
Encyclopedia of Science Fiction to his dismay He describes the Draka series as dystopias based 
on "supposing that everything had turned out as badly as possible these last few The 
title page of his nonDraka novel Conquistador has the quotation "There is a technical term 
for someone who confuses the opinions of a character in a book with those of 
Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate

Yorke and longtime collaborator Stanley Donwood depicts nature and spirits inspired by fairy tales Radiohead 
released no singles from The King of Limbs but released a music video for "Lotus 
Flower" featuring Yorke's dancing that spawned an internet meme In they began an international tour 
with several festival appearances The European tour was postponed after the temporary stage collapsed in 
Toronto’s Downsview Park killing a technician and injuring three others The King of Limbs was

Billboard The King of Limbs was followed by the remix album TKOL RMX the live 
video The King of Limbs Live from the Basement and the outtakes "Supercollider" and "The 
Butcher" Radiohead worked on The King of Limbs with longtime producer Nigel Godrich intermittently from 
May to January It was recorded at the home of actress Drew Barrymore in Los 
Radiohead wanted to avoid repeating the protracted recording process of their previous album In Rainbows 
According to singer Thom Yorke the band felt that "if we are gonna carry on 
we need to do it for a new set of Cover artist Stanley Donwood said 
that whereas In Rainbows was "very much a definitive statement" the band wanted to make 
an album that was more Multiinstrumentalist Jonny Greenwood said "We didn't want to pick up 
guitars and write chord sequences We didn't want to sit in front of a computer 
either We wanted a third thing which involved playing and Whereas Radiohead developed In Rainbows 
from live performance The King of Limbs developed from studio Yorke sought to move further 
from conventional recording After he and Godrich became interested in DJing during their time in 
Los Angeles Godrich proposed a twoweek experiment whereby the band used turntables and vinyl emulation 
software instead of conventional According to Godrich "That twoweek experiment ended up being fucking six 
months And that’s that record the whole story of all of Radiohead assembled much of 
the album by looping and editing samples of their They used sampling software written by 
Greenwood which he described as a "wonky rubbish version" of Ableton Radiohead used this to 
create sequences of music to which Yorke wrote melodies and a process he likened to 
editing a Guitarist Ed O'Brien told Rolling Stone "The brick walls we tended to hit 
were when we knew something was great like 'Bloom' but not finished Then Colin Greenwood 
had that bassline and Thom started singing Those things suddenly made it a hundred times 
According to Godrich "The result was a huge and gigantic mess that took me about 
a year and a half to On January Radiohead suspended recording to perform at the 
Henry Fonda Theatre Hollywood to raise funds for Oxfam responding to the Haiti earthquake The 
show was released free online in December as Radiohead for and included a solo performance 
of the future King of Limbs track "Lotus Flower" by Yorke on acoustic According to 
Rolling Stone The King of Limbs saw Radiohead move further from conventional rock music and 
song structures in favour of "moody rhythmheavy electronica glacially paced ballads and ambient It makes 
prominent use of sampling looping and ambient including samples of natural sounds such as birdsong 
and Pitchfork described its music as "aggressive rhythms made out of dainty bits of digital 
detritus robotically repetitive yet humanly offkilter parched thickets of drumming graced with fleeting moments of 
melodic Several critics noted dubstep According to O'Brien "Rhythm is the king of limbs The 
rhythm dictates the record It's very The first track "Bloom" was inspired by the BBC 
nature documentary series The Blue It opens with a piano loop and features horns and 
complex "Morning Mr Magpie" has "restless "Little by Little" features "crumbling guitar shapes" and "clattering" 
"Feral" features scattered vocal and "mulchedup" "Lotus Flower" features a driving synth bassline and Yorke's 
"Codex" is a piano ballad with "spectral" horns and and a Roland drum "Give Up 
the Ghost" is an acoustic guitar ballad with layered vocal The final track "Separator" has 
guitar and piano a "brittle" drum loop and echoing Yorke said he felt The King 
of Limbs was a "visual" album with lyrics and artwork about "wildness" and "mutating" inspired 
by his environmental The album title may refer to the King of Limbs an ancient 
oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest near Tottenham House where Radiohead recorded In At eight 
tracks and minutes in length The King of Limbs is Radiohead's shortest O'Brien explained that 
Radiohead felt the ideal album was around minutes long and cited Marvin Gaye's What's Going 
On as a classic record shorter than The King of The artwork was created by 
Yorke with longtime Radiohead collaborator Stanley Donwood intended to paint oil portraits of the Radiohead 
members in the style of Gerhard Richter but abandoned the idea as "I'd never painted 
with oils before and I'm not Gerhard Richter so it was just a series of 
painted As with previous Radiohead albums Donwood worked on the artwork as the band recorded 
nearby; the music made Donwood think of "immense multicoloured cathedrals of trees with music echoing 
from the branches whilst strange fauna lurked in the Donwood and Yorke drew trees with 
eyes limbs mouths and creating "strange multilimbed creatures that are neither malevolent or benevolent" inspired 
by Northern European fairy For the special "newspaper" edition of The King of Limbs Donwood 
wanted to create something "in a state of He chose newspaper which fades in sunlight

Jay Griffiths and Robert Radiohead did not perform The King of Limbs live until several 
months after its release as Yorke wanted to continue studio work and it took some 
time to arrange the album for To perform the album's complex rhythms they enlisted a

The Good Samaritan Children's Home is an orphanage in Velika Dobrony Zakarpattia Oblast Ukraine Established 
in the orphanage serves girls ages through and is operated by the Reformed Church of 
Transcarpathia In the mid the Dutch relief organisation Stichting Hulp OostEuropa delivered a large amount 
of humanitarian relief to many Ukrainian state orphanages This however failed to reach the children 
Having satisfied themselves that this was the case and in view of the dreadful state 
of affairs prevailing at that time in Ukrainian state orphanages; the lack of basic hygiene 
indifference towards the children the physically and mentally retarded condition of the children the poor 
condition of the buildings and the impracticality of improvement they decided to set up a 
Christian children's home which could serve as a model for the whole of Ukraine At 
the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union Stichting Hulp OostEuropa together with the 
Weeshuis der Hervormden Lindenhof and the Partnerhilfe foundations started to organise this and by March 
after two years of construction the brand new twocone basic building more than feet in 
Nagydobrony near Uzhhorod in Ukraine was ready for occupation On December the children's home was 
handed over with all due ceremony to the district of the Reformed Church of Transcarpathia 
to which it officially belongs From its inception the establishment made every endeavour after selfsufficiency 
by setting up its own farm Supporting funds were sufficient from the very beginning for 
a wide variety of things so much so that whatever new building was needed it 
could be built from the surplus In the course of time however due to continually 
rising prices and cost of wages coupled with stagnation of supporting funds not only was 
the work unable to be finished but now the yearly support funds do not even 
cover the minimum annual wage of the children's carers alone In reality the majority of 
the workers are on a partly voluntary basis Compensation for the belowaverage wages is by 
allowances in kind and other concessions eg holiday leave Electricity and gas is purchased at 
industrial prices and for that reason it has not been possible so far to implement 
gas heating it is too expensive The Ukrainian state has provided no material assistance apart 
from an uptodate computer in February from the district council As one of the models 
for the country the children's home is visited every year by government ministers various regional 
medical officers and some church bishops too The children's home itself is situated in an 
area of acres Here is the main building and a large outbuilding which everybody simply 
refers to as the "new building" In this area too are the cowshed stables pig 
shed and various other farm buildings garages the workshop and stores There are polytunnels ie 
polyethylene greenhouses which alone cover an area of SF It can be seen from the 
foregoing how much dependence there is on the farm set up through considerable effort together 
with gifts from abroad In the fields and polytunnels among other things carrots parsley kohlrabi 
potatoes radish cauliflower peas beans tomatoes paprika beetroot cabbage etc are grown Out of this 
other institutions are supported too An apiary provides honey for the children Cattle and pig 
stocks provide meat and dairy produce milk sour cream and cottage cheese Altogether approx acres 
is under cereals spelt durum wheat and other milling wheat providing allyearround feeding for the 
animals Unfortunately more often than not they are unsuitable for bread flour The working bakery 
supplies the daily bread requirements also rolls and approx types of bakery produce The bakery 
was set up with the help of donations from the Netherlands and the USA and 
has been in production since December The agricultural work required implements so the staff partly 
from donations set up a machine pool consisting of several tractors The upkeep and repair 
of the tractors and implements is done by the staff Since there has been a 
combine harvester and in the SARA foundation in the United States USA donated a brand 
new Belarus tractor The children take part in looking after the animals and in agricultural 
work so that they may experience what kind of work provides the food that reaches 
the table The aim for the children is that they should become useful members of 
the community For those children who on account of handicap will not be able to 
leave the children's home an appropriate field of activity is ensured so that they will 
not feel themselves superfluous So those girls wishing to proceed to further studies get wholehearted 
support to help them reach the goals they have set themselves There are a great 
many foreign visitors so from a guest house has provided suitable accommodation for supporters The 
guest house provides a conference hall with a seating capacity of giving opportunity to different 
organisations and groups to organise conferences eg medical mental health care agriculture etc The children's 
home keeps up a very good relationship with state orphanages schools children's hospitals psychiatric hospitals 
and institutions for the blind and deaf From the crops and the humanitarian aid received 
distribution is made according to ability to the abovementioned and other institutions Children from years 
old to years old are taken in but only girls Admission does not consider creed 
or ethnic background; only their need of help ie difficult social environment or those who 
are seriously handicapped physically or psychologically orphans oneparent children or those in situations where they 
are endangered of the children are such as have been given up by their parents 
years old children with various medical conditions have come from state orphanages each one of 
them diagnosed there as mentally and physically handicapped and lacking the ability to speak By 
the grace of God love and care can work wonders since nearly all of these 
children can now speak and right now children out of the in the home attend 
the village school and not with poor results either Five are now and year pupils 
in the Nagydobrony Reformed Lyceum From among the primary school children attend music school In 
the children's home itself there is a special class children do not go to school 
go to this special class and the other have already finished school and now work 
one as a kitchen assistant and the other as a secretary in the home This 
is not a closed institution like the state orphanages These children who are physically and 
mentally capable of attending school go by themselves to Nagydobrony High School more than yards 
away The older children attend church and take part in other activities too Here the 
children know the people in the village they see the flowers trees and animals belonging 
to the houses They learn the rules of the road they know their environment they 
meet friends and so it wil be easier for them later on to make their 
way in life Over and above this the children will stay as long as they 
need to that is for their whole lives Members of the local and neighbouring congregations 
can take their "own children" home from noon on Saturday till Sunday afternoon every second 
week Only such persons can do this as are morally suitable We seek by means 
of these family visits to form in the children a true picture of Christian family 
life which in a state institution they could never experience The children are divided into 
groups In setting up each group age personality and physical and mental capabilities are taken 
into account In each group there are children Each room has its own washroom and 
the disabled have their own specially fitted out washroom Education is provided in the building 
for those who are either physically incapable of going to school or who are mentally 
retarded In the grounds there is a flower bed yards long by wide for the 
children where even those confined to wheelchairs can enjoy the pleasure of gardening In the 
building there is a computer room with permanent internet access a therapy room a library 
a study room and a practice kitchen The children have the possibility of using various 
openair recreational facilities suited to each age group There are three small play areas a 
soccer field a feet diameter swimming pool and the opportunity to go horse riding too 
there is also a fish pond on which it is possible to go boating and 
each child who can ride a bicycle has one of her own The children often 
go on trips to the nearby woods and regularly organise various outings during the holidays 
Visits are made to the well known sights and towns of Carpathia Sometimes neighbouring towns

the appearance of being a Kikuyuled Officially sanctioned by the colonial government at its peak 
in the Home Guard numbered more than men—more than the number of Mau Mau fighters 
in the Many joined voluntarily for a variety of reasons but particularly once the battle 
had begun to shift decisively against Mau Mau by late however in some districts up 
to of Home Guard members were MajorGeneral Sir William 'Loony' put the Home Guard under 
command of European district officers—these district officers were not trained military personnel but rather settlers 
or career often quite junior colonialofficers Hinde recruited Colonel Philip Morcombe to head up the 
Home Guard Once set up it quickly began working alongside the British military Within a 
month of the Lari massacre of the Home Guard were armed with shotguns and given 
a uniform and eventually nearly all of them would be supplied with precision weapons of 
some kind and By the majority of the Guard were stood down since Mau Mau 
no longer constituted a major threat and the remainder of the guard were absorbed into 
the Tribal Policecitation needed As noted above the Guard was organised by the Kenya Administration 
rather than the Army or Police and Temporary District Officers were appointed to officer the 
guard In most cases individual platoons and sections of the Guard were officered by junior 
administration officials such as chiefs and headmen The Guard undertook a variety of mission roles 
For the majority of the time they guarded the fortified villages that had been set 
up to protect the Kikuyu from the Mau Mau In the early period of the 
Guard it was common for the Mau Mau to overrun these fortified positions because the 
Guard lacked sufficient firepower to resist their attackers In due course as the Guard demonstrated 
its political and military reliability the Kenya Government supplied shotguns and rifles to the Guard 
The Guard also took part in antiMau Mau sweeps and local patrolling Their local knowledge 
and intimate understanding of the Mau Mau made them very effective in this role It 
is estimated that the Tribal Police and the Home Guard were responsible for some of 
all Mau Mau deaths making them the most effective branch of the Kenya security forces 
The Tribal Police Home Guard was behind the capture of the head of the Mau

Autor and Gordon Hanson find that rising imports from China caused higher unemployment lower labour 
force participation and reduced wages in local US labour markets that house manufacturing industries that 
compete with those imports explaining up to a quarter of the decline in US manufacturing 
At the individual level persons who worked in in manufacturing industries in which imports from 
China grew strongly experienced lower aggregate earnings and change firms and industries more often with 
churning particularly concentrated among those who had low initial wages tenure or labour force attachment 
while highwage workers are much better able to adjust in case they are forced out

trade with China grow in the as imports accelerate labour markets in the US with 
industries less exposed to Chinese trade but characterized by a high routine task content still

Katz Christina Patterson and John van Reenen have connected the fall of the labour share 
in the US to the rise of "superstar firms" by arguing that globalization andor technological

fought on behalf of a community of to appeal a eviction order It is a 
national organization which brings together multiple communities and their leaders who live in slum settlements

Poor Fund International Network Due to the efforts of NSDF around buildings and toilet blocks 
have been constructed in Mumbai providing houses and sanitation to over Additionally around toilet blocks 
have been constructed in In the NSDF formed an alliance with Mahila Milan and and 
this alliance became the basis for establishing Slum Dwellers International in In National Slum Dwellers 
Federation won the UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award The National Slum Dwellers Federation was 
started after the demolition of the Janata Colony in Mumbai It was one of the 
largest slums in Mumbai and had mostly a South Indian population In the Bhabha Atomic 
Research Centre gave an eviction notice to all residents to vacate the land Jockin Arputham 
who was years old then was also a resident To contest the eviction the residents 
had to prove that they were permanent residents and have the right to live there 
This colony was formed in and the rent was anywhere between Indian Paise to Indian 
The documentation proved that this was a permanent settlement and a legal settlement thus the 
residents were not illegally staying there By Jockin was travelling all around Mumbai and India 
to meet other slum leaders and dwellers to help fight the eviction order All the 
activists involved worked to make sure that eviction notices could not be served However when 
the eviction notices were finally ordered the activists went to the district court and won 
The Atomic Energy Commission took it to the High Court and won Finally the case 
was taken to the Supreme Court and the acitivists won However then Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi was personally interested in that land and one Supreme Court judge while speaking to 
Jockin mentioned how it is too late to stop the eviction due to the Prime 
Minister After a long while a meeting was conducted with Indira Gandhi and a conclusion 
was reached that there will be no demolition of the slums without the consultation of 
the slum dwellers and their leaders Yet due to the National Emergency declared by Indira 
Gandhi fresh eviction orders were given and an arrest warrant for the slum leaders was 
also issued A huge demolition took place and all people were moved to Cheetah In 
the NSDF was formed and multiple slums around India followed this example and formed their

The Toledan Tables or Tables of Toledo were astronomical tables which were used to predict 
the movements of the Sun Moon and planets relative to the fixed stars They were 
completed around year by a group of Arabic astronomers at Toledo Spain They had started 
as preexisting Arabic tables made elsewhere and were numerically adjusted to be centered on the 
location of In modern English astronomy tables of movements of astronomical bodies are called ephemerides 
The Tables of Toledo were partly based on the work of alZarqali known to the 
West as Arzachel an Arab mathematician astronomer astronomy instrumentmaker and astrologer who lived in Toledo 
The tables were produced by a team whose membership is largely unknown with the exception 
of alZarqali Toledo came under Christian Spanish rule in the shortly after the tables were 
completed A century later at Toledo the ArabictoLatin translator Gerard of Cremona translated for Latin 
readers the Tables of Toledo the most accurate compilation in Europe at the time During 
the midthirteenth century Campanus of Novara constructed tables for the meridian of Novara from the

were produced at Toledo in Spanish and Latin from the original tables of two centuries 
The descendants of the Toledan Tables as updated with some corrections were the most widely

The Laval Rouge et Or football team represents Laval University in Quebec City in the 
sport of Canadian football in U Sports The program began its first regular season in 
and has quickly become one of the most successful programs in Canadian collegiate football history 
The Rouge et Or have won a record ten Vanier Cup championships and their most 
recent victory occurred at the Vanier Cup in They are also the only program to 
have played in four straight Vanier Cups and have a record of in Vanier Cup 
The Rouge et Or have also won the Dunsmore Cup times since demonstrating their historical 
dominance in their conference The Rouge et Or football program was first conceived of by 
Mike Labadie a local physical education teacher and Jacques Tanguay a wealthy alumni and avid 
sports They had noticed that there were an exodus of Frenchspeaking football players to English 
speaking schools because there was no Francophone option for them to continue their football careers 
Tanguay invested heavily into the football program as the Rouge et Or began their first 
season in one year after the National Hockey League's Quebec Nordiques had left Quebec City 
to relocate to Labadie was the team's first head coach and they finished the year 
with a The following year Jacques Chapdelaine was hired to become the team's head coach 
The Rouge et Or were the first Canadian collegiate team to feature fulltime paid assistant 
coaches and the first to use video editing further giving them a heightened competitive Laval 
won their first national championship in against the Saint Mary's Huskies under head coach Chapdelaine 
bringing the Vanier Cup back to Quebec for the first time since Chapdelaine left the 
program following the season to continue his coaching career in the Canadian Football League In 
current head coach Glen Constantin was promoted from his defensive coordinator position and led the 
team to record and another Dunsmore However during that season the program had to vacate 
all victories due to use of an ineligible player Consequently that season is recorded as 
having eight regular season losses and three playoff For the following season in the Rouge 
et Or finished and lost to the Concordia Stingers in the QUFL semifinal This is 
notable because as of it is the last time that the Rouge et Or have 
had more than one regular season loss and the last time the program failed to 
qualify for the Dunsmore Cup The following season the Rouge et Or began their conference 
dominance scoring a school record points in eight regular season games over points on average 
per game en route to their second Dunsmore Cup The Rouge et Or finished that 
season with their second Vanier Cup victory also against Saint Mary's in the Vanier Cup 
which was Constantin's first as head In the Rouge et Or repeated as Vanier Cup 
champions for the first time in school history by defeating the Saskatchewan Huskies in the 
Vanier Laval became the fourth program in Canadian collegiate history to repeat as Vanier Cup 
champions It was the lowest scoring game in Vanier Cup history as Laval won by 
a score of and it was the first Vanier Cup held outside of Toronto as 
the game was played at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton In the Saskatchewan Huskies collected 
a measure of revenge as they defeated the Rouge et Or in the semifinal Mitchell 
Bowl in Saskatoon However in the following year the two teams met again in the 
Vanier Cup where the Vanier Cup was being played in Saskatoon for the first time 
and in the Huskies home stadium Griffiths The team claimed the rubber match by defeating 
the Saskatchewan Huskies in a game played in temperatures below Linebacker Éric Maranda that game's 
MVP was chosen to play in the US East–West Shrine Game in Houston Texas on 
January For the season the Rouge et Or claimed their fifth straight Dunsmore Cup championship 
but lost to the Saint Mary's Huskies in the Uteck Bowl in Huskies Stadium in 
Halifax It marked the last time as of that Laval had lost to a team 
from the Atlantic University Sport conference The following year Laval ranked first in Canada played 
in the Vanier Cup and defeated the thirdranked Western Mustangs to claim their fifth national 
It was the eighth time that Laval had finished their season paying in a national 
final or semifinal and oddly the first of those occurrences where the opposing team was 
not nicknamed the "Huskies" The season also saw the program produce its first Hec Crighton 
Trophy winner as Benoit Groulx was named the CIS football's most valuable Laval University hosted 
the Vanier Cup game for the first time in but the Rouge et Or lost 
to the eventual champion Queen's Golden Gaels in the Mitchell Bowl played at Richardson Memorial 
Stadium in Kingston However Laval was hosting backtoback Vanier Cup games and the Rouge et 
Or qualified for the Vanier Cup in There the Rouge et Or dominated the Calgary 
Dinos to win their sixth Vanier Cup They were the first team in CIS history 
to win straight games in weeks of play after they played nine regular season games 
in The RSEQ extended the regular season to nine games in Their defence also set 
a Vanier Cup record for fewest yards allowed beating the previous record of allowed by 
the Guelph Gryphons in Laval won in front of hometown fans becoming the second program 
to win the Vanier Cup at home with the Toronto Varsity Blues winning in and 
In the following season Laval lost a Vanier Cup game for the first time in 
program history as they fell to the McMaster Marauders in double overtime in the Vanier 
This game was played at BC Place and was the first Vanier Cup to be 
played in The Rouge et Or would exact a measure of revenge the following year 
in a rematch against the Marauders in the Vanier The team won a Canadian collegiate 
record seventh Vanier Cup championship in front of an also record crowd of fans at 
the Rogers Centre in Toronto by a score of In they won backtoback national championships 
for the second time in program history when they defeated the Calgary Dinos in the 
Vanier Cup by a score of The game was again played at Telus Stadium on 
the campus of Laval University in front of The season saw the full rise of 
the Montreal Carabins to prominence as they not only defeated the Rouge et Or in 
the regular season but they also defeated them in the postseason and at home in 
the Dunsmore Cup It snapped Laval's home winning streak combined regular season and postseason and 
Dunsmore Cup winning Proving that was no fluke the Carabins again defeated the Rouge et 
Or the following year in Quebec City in the Dunsmore Cup and would again represent 
the RSEQ in the Vanier In the Rouge et Or finished in second place in 
the RSEQ after losing the headtohead tiebreaker to the Carabins Nonetheless they defeated those Carabins 
in Montreal in the Dunsmore Cup and advanced to their tenth Vanier Cup appearance in 
the Vanier Cup In that game the Rouge et Or came back on top by 
squeezing a narrow victory against the Calgary Dinos in Hamilton at Tim Hortons The Rouge 
et Or qualified for the Vanier Cup the following year but were soundly defeated by 
the Western Mustangs by a score of It was their most lopsided loss since they 
were defeated by the Saint Mary's Huskies by a similar margin in their loss in 
the Uteck Bowl In the Rouge et Or would exact a measure of revenge by 
returning to the national championship game and defeating the Mustangs by a score of in 
front of a home crowd in the Vanier Cup The win capped the fourth undefeated 
season in program history On October a record fans attended the Rouge et Or game 
against the Montreal Carabins as the program celebrated their The team finished in first place

Ocean Girl titled Ocean Odyssey in the UK is an Australian science fiction TV series 
aimed for family audiences and starring Marzena Godecki as the lead character The show is 
set in the near future and focuses on an unusual girl named Neri who lives 
alone on an island and the friendships she develops with the inhabitants of an underwater 
research facility called ORCA Oceanic Research Centre of Australia the show is an example of 
deep ecology science fiction Ocean Girl inspired an animated series The New Adventures of Ocean 
Girl which ran from to and has since been released on DVD The animated series 
is in a distinct reboot separate from the original liveaction show Neri the title character 
is a young girl with an affinity for water the ability to swim long distances 
and superhuman lung capacity She lives alone on an otherwise deserted island and sleeps in 
a nest in a tree Early in the first season Neri befriends two Australian boys; 
Jason and Brett Bates The Bates brothers live in an elaborate underwater research and environmental 
protection facility called ORCA Oceanic Research Center of Australia located near Port Douglas Queensland At 
the beginning of the series their mother Dr Dianne Bates has been assigned to ORCA 
to study whale song in the hopes of facilitating crossspecies communication A significant portion of 
the series takes place on ORCA itself and looks at the activities of its inhabitants 
which includes the schoolaged children of the resident scientists such as Jason and Brett Jason 
discovers Neri while on a whaletracking expedition with his mother While attempting to tag a 
whale using a harpoon from the boat Jason is startled by a young girl Neri 
who appears in the water and positions herself between Jason and the whale saying "No 
no" Jason freezes and fails to release the harpoon Dr Bates rushes out to the 
ship's deck grabs the harpoon and tags the whale albeit missing the intended target area 
Dr Bates is furious with Jason and doesn't believe his story about a girl appearing 
in the water Actually no one believes Jason at first and he is ridiculed by 
the other children on ORCA Brett is the second character to know of Neri's existence 
Brett and Jason's friendship with Neri is at first a highly guarded secret due to 
Neri's fear of other humans As the series progresses it is revealed that Neri came 
to Earth on a spaceship with her father when she was young though his death 
soon after the ship's crash left Neri to fend for herself Prior to meeting Jason 
and Brett Neri's only friend was a humpback whale a jali in Neri's native tongue 
whom she names "Charley" and with whom she can communicate Later in the series Neri's 
curiosity leads her to explore ORCA while Dr Bates's study of Charley's whale song helps 
her identify Neri as the intended recipient of that song Eventually Dr Bates and her 
assistant Dr Winston Seth become embroiled in Jason and Brett's effort to keep Neri a 
secret while also performing numerous tests on Neri to understand how she's able to communicate 
with whales At the same time that the Bates family learn about Neri a rival 
research organisation the UBRI Corporation are introduced Headed by the sinister Dr Hellegren UBRI have 
learned that a spacecraft landed somewhere in the vicinity of ORCA and begin their own 
search for any personnel that may have survived Simultaneously they work on other projects which 
threaten the natural ecology of the ocean around ORCA Eventually they put in play an 
effort to build the socalled "ORCA City" an elaborate underwater construction that will likely eradicate 
much of the natural life on the seabed In response Dr Bates's mission changes over 
the course of the series from cetologist to environmental protectionist This role becomes more prominent 
beginning with the third season when UBRI representatives establish themselves on board ORCA Accordingly the 
series shifts to a more serious tone in its later seasons As Neri gradually discovers 
more of her island and ORCA she also begins to understand her greater purpose This 
selfawakening is particularly enhanced by encounters with others of her kind In the second season 
she discovers her sister Mera and the two are given the opportunity to return to 
their home planet Mera avails herself of this option but Neri stays feeling that she 
must discover what her father was trying to do on Earth In the third season 
she gains entry into the downed spacecraft that originally brought her to Earth There she 
finds another of her people in suspended animation The new character Kal proves to be 
the son of the commander of the vessel and helps her tap into the ship's 
memory core She finds the ship's log in which Kal's mother explains that Neri's father 
was to repair the damage done to Earth's oceans with an advanced device called the 
Synchronium She then dedicates her life to her father's cause giving her a genuine sense 
of purpose that she had perhaps lacked earlier in the series Kal grows jealous of 
the strong bond between Neri and Jason Bates and begins hating Neri's friends on ORCA 
As protest Kal leaves the island Neri and her ORCA mates go looking for him 
but are unable to find him as he's been captured by UBRI UBRI tricks Kal 
into believing that the male should lead as he had been indoctrinated into the matriarchal 
social mores of his people and he creates an alliance with Dr Hellegren to steal 
the Synchronium pieces that Neri and Mera have hidden in a secret cave While the 
primary cast gets new motivations by UBRI's move to ORCA and Kal's appearance on the 
island the secondary cast radically changes at the outset of the third season All of 
the original kids are replaced by a new crew and more adults are added to 
the ORCA staff As Neri begins her father's mission she is drawn farther and farther 
away from her island Beginning in the middle of the third season some episodes are 
primarily based on land By the fourth season some episodes are set in Egypt and 
her father's quest eventually leads her back to the "Ocean Planet" her home planet Most 
of the plots involving the secondary kids on ORCA are reduced in the final season 
in order to allow for greater exploration of Neri's homeworld Several new characters of Neri's 
species are introduced Likewise the threat of UBRI fades to be replaced by a new 
organization PRAXIS Preventative Response and eXtraterritorial Intelligence Service and by rebels on the Ocean Planet 
This group is dedicated to protecting against any threats posed by extraterrestrial life and it's 
agents comes to believe Neri and her people are a problem for Earth They thus 
chased Neri and the Bates boys around the world When a mysterious underwater pyramid is 
discovered in the ocean Neri and the Bates boys enter it and discover more about 
the Ocean Planet and Neri's mission on Earth When the rebellion in the Ocean World 
is growing Mera escapes to Earth and is reunited with Neri But PRAXIS sees this 
pyramid as a danger to the Earth Much of the final season is thus concerned 
with PRAXIS' attempt to attack the pyramid as well as with a "Red Virus" which 
is spreading in the oceans of Neri's homeworld the Ocean Planet Eventually in the series 
finale Jason Brett and Neri are able to repulse PRAXIS' efforts and the rebellion and 
Earth is saved Neri remains on Earth as the ambassador of the Ocean Planet and 
she and Jason finally become a couple The Bates family Winston Neri Charley and the 
ORCA computer HELEN Hydro Electronic Liaison ENtity are the only constant characters for the show's 
entire run However the part of Dr Bates is recast with Liz Burch after the 
second season Kerry Armstrong being committed workwise and HELEN is "upgraded" in the fourth and 
final season While Ocean Girl featured the ensemble cast listed above there were several characters 
who appeared for one season each with four children appearing in two seasons each three 
in Seasons and one in Seasons and as well as a few adults appearing in 
more than one season Most of the cast changes were explained by their "friends" or 
rather their parents having been transferred back to shore with the exception of Season where 
it was not noted at all The original Ocean Girl series ran on Australia's Network

MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park was a theme park adjacent to the MGM Grand hotel 
and casino in Paradise Nevada United States It operated from to The original plan for 
the theme park was to make it familyoriented by providing activities for children The overall 
Wizard of Oz theming of the hotel and casino provided the motto to literally "follow 
the yellow brick road" from inside the hotel to the entrance to the theme park 
which was built on the hotel's backlot Opened on December along with the rest of 
the complex the then ha MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park looked like a smallversion of 
larger counterparts Disney's Hollywood Studios and Universal Studios which utilized a movie studiobacklot theme During 
a later expansion of the hotel's pool and convention facilities the area of the park 
was reduced by to an area of acres For the theme park was renamed The 
Park at MGM Grand and served as a rental facility for corporate functions before being 
closed permanently in Since the property has been occupied by The Signature at MGM Grand 
MGM Grand Adventures opened on acres of land on December From to the park was 
renamed Scream Park each October for This separate admission event included several haunted houses in 
and around the park's attractions In May the MGM Grand planned an million reconfiguration of 
the park which had performed below expectations The plan included relocating and lengthening its roller 
In June and July MGM Grand Adventures offered "Bustin' Loose" summer block parties in which 
the park was converted into three separately themed areas with live entertainment and interactive In 
May a pool spa and a squarefoot conference center were being built on acres of 
land previously occupied by a portion of MGM Grand reducing the park to Additions and 
improvements were being made to the theme park in June In MGM Grand Adventures switched 
to a seasonal with the park usually reopening in April and continuing operations through the 
In July MGM Mirage reviewed the park's land for possible alternative uses despite being pleased 
with its The park closed on September At the end of the month MGM Mirage 
began putting all of the park's rides and attractions up for sale through a California 
amusement park equipment broker while cautioning that the park could reopen in spring if the 
equipment could not be sold for an adequate In February MGM Mirage announced plans to 
rename MGM Grand Adventures as The Park at MGM The park would only be open 
for group business and special events with or more people with general admission tickets no 
longer being issued The park retained three rides a amphitheater and two theaters Keeping the 
park open for special events was used to generate income while still considering other options 
for the land including the development of timeshares luxury condominiums entertainment complexes or additional casino 
and hotel The park permanently closed in after a Jimmy Buffett "Parrothead" private party on 
Memorial Daycitation needed According to the Las Vegas Sun the park "flopped because it lacked 
any exciting and suffered from low attendance because of expensive ticket The Las Vegas ReviewJournal 
opined that the park "failed to take into consideration that a third of its visitors 
come from California where theme parks are ubiquitous and always racing to unveil the latest 
in thrill On December MGM Mirage announced plans to build a luxury condominium and hotel 
complex on the site of the closed theme MGM Grand Adventures was replaced by The 
Signature at MGM Over the years the park saw several changes It opened with expensive 
ticket by standards with an admission charge of for adults that were not guests of 
the hotel Over time this fee was reduced in order to better match the caliber 
of attractions in the park and to increase attendance By entry was and for the 
Halloween Scream Park Promotions such as summer nighttime concerts and spring break events were done 
to draw more crowds with additional attractions such as bungee runs and bounce houses added 
for those events In a move to put some thrills in the park in the 
park added Sky Screamer a skycoaster Riders were strapped into harnesses and lifted up a 
"launch tower" where they then pulled a ripcord setting into motion a free fall upwards 
of It was placed over a lagoon that had once been home to a large 
faux steamboat a snack bar was its only residentcitation needed As of it was billed 
as the world's largest sky The result was a very tall structure that could be 
seen from anywhere in the park At night it was lighted in the same green 
color as the hotel tower providing an impressive visual Over time the lineup of attractions 
changed especially with the expansion of the hotel's pool and convention facilities These changes also 
meant the entrance to the park was drastically changed and now involved a lengthy walk 
from the hotel making the park seem like a separate entity The reduction in area 
of the park entailed the removal of the Backlot River Tour Deep Earth Exploration and 
Manhattan Theatre Although unaffected by the layout change The Haunted Mine was also closed The 
Lightning Bolt was initially an indoor roller coaster In it had been relocated outdoors to 
the northern end of the to a former special event space in the northwest corner 
The ride was later expanded by Arrow Dynamics to include a second lift needed and 
an extended run over the Grand Canyon For a short time other smaller temporary flatrides 
called the park home including a Chance Rides Zipper Ferris Wheel and Chaos None of 
these attractions stayed very long but did help increase the attractions count Another addition to 
the park came in the form of "Kiddie Island" This was an island created in 
the lagoon near the base of Sky Screamer It was home to a variety of 
small attractions such as a paddle boat river Red Baron airplane ride and Carousel MGM 
Grand Adventures Theme Park was built around a movie studio theme and provided for somewhat 
of a Disneytype It had several themed including Casablanca Plaza New York Street Asian Village 
French Street Salem Waterfront Tumbleweed Gulch Rio Grande Cantina New Orleans Street and Olde England

Dyce railway station is a railway station serving the town of Dyce Aberdeen Scotland The 
station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line with 
some trains operating on the Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line and Glasgow to Aberdeen Line also 
extended to call at Dyce and Inverurie This gives direct service from Dyce to Aberdeen 
Dundee Edinburgh Glasgow Inverness and intermediate stations Although Dyce station is located next to the 
runway of Aberdeen Airport and aircraft can be seen landing and taking off from the 
station platform there is no direct link between Dyce station and the airport as the 
passenger terminal is the other side of the runway The station here was opened along 
with the line in by the Great North of Scotland It later became a junction 
for the Formartine and Buchan Railway which diverged here and headed north to Peterhead and 
Fraserburgh; this opened to traffic in and had its own platforms alongside the main line 
ones Passenger services over both branches ended as a result of the Beeching Axe on 
October but the station remained open until May Freight continued to Peterhead until and to 
Fraserburgh until October There is still evidence on the ground of the old branch platforms 
which sat on the site of the station car park The former branch lines are 
now a long distance cycle path accessible from the western end of the car park 
The station was reopened by British Rail in September The station has two platforms connected 
by a new fully accessible footbridge implemented in The station is unstaffed and there is 
no ticket office but automatic ticket vending machines are provided Other facilities include car park 
taxi rank cycle storage seating and a simple shelter on each platform Automated announcements customer 
help points timetable posters and train information displays offer running information Both platforms are fully 
accessible for disabled passengers with lifts in the footbridge and level access from the main 
car park to platform A pub the Spider's Web is located next to the station 
Dyce is a popular station with airport passengers business travellers and commuters both to and 
from Aberdeen There has been massive growth of Dyce station from passengers in to more 
than three times that number in In addition to Dyce and the many businesses in 
the area the station also serves the airport and is popular with oil workers returning 
from the rigs In addition to the DyceJet Connect shuttle bus a taxi rank provides 
a different means of transport to the airport terminal A busonly turning circle was constructed 
in to provide quick links between the station and airport Dyce signal box which opened 
in is a tall structure located at the south Aberdeen end of the station on 
the east side of the railway In the box was provided with a new frame 
of levers subsequently reduced in size to levers Dyce lost its semaphore signals in October 
when new colour light signals were brought into use The lever frame was removed from 
the signal box renamed from "Dyce Junction" to "Dyce" and a new relay interlocking and 
'NX' entranceexit panel was installed initially housed inside a temporary signal box A new freight 
terminal named "Raiths Farm" has been built to the north of Dyce station in a 
field on the west side of the railway Construction of the terminal was completed in 
November The Raiths Farm facility replaced the Guild Street yard at Aberdeen allowing the latter 
site which occupied valuable land close to the city centre to be redeveloped The Raiths 
Farm layout comprises arrival and departure lines to the north and south a runround loop 
and four sidings The facility began operations in There is an Half hourly service in 
each direction Mondays to Saturdays to Aberdeen and Inverurie with eleven of the latter trains 
continuing to Seven Aberdeen trains run through to Edinburgh and one two on Saturdays to 
Glasgow along with an evening commuter service to There are nine southbound and eleven northbound 
departures on Sundays five of the latter running to Inverness Until May Stagecoach Bluebird's operated 
a Jet Connect bus shuttle service between Dyce station and Aberdeen Airport terminal but this 
service was discontinued due to low passenger Instead direct bus services run between the airport 
and Union Square in Aberdeen city centre where passengers can transfer from Aberdeen railway station 
Service frequencies are to be improved here from as part of a timetable recast funded 
by Transport Scotland An "Aberdeen Crossrail" commuter service is to be introduced between Montrose and 
Inverurie which will call here and the other intermediate stations enroute once per hour in 
each The Aberdeen to Inverurie frequency will also be upped to every minutes with several 
of the existing Inverness trains combined with Aberdeen to Glasgow Edinburgh express services to maintain 
through journey opportunities A million project to upgrade the Aberdeen to Inverness line will also 
see the track through here redoubled by The first stage of this work began in 
May with trains from the north terminating here and a railreplacement bus service in operation 
tofrom Aberdeen to allow the required track and signalling improvements to be carried out The 
line will remain closed from May until August The line was duly redoubled between Aberdeen 
and Inverurie by the end of Due to the proximity of Dyce station to Aberdeen 
Airport schemes have been proposed to create a rail link to the passenger terminal on 
the other side of the runway A million rail link between the airport and Aberdeen 
has been proposed as part of the project to redevelop the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference 
An open mail relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP server configured in such 
a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send email through it not 
just mail destined to or originating from known This used to be the default configuration 
in many mail servers; indeed it was the way the Internet was initially set up 
but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms 
Many relays were closed or were placed on blacklists by other servers Until the mail 
servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact this was frequently the installation 
default The traditional store and forward method of relaying email to its destination required that 
it was passed from computer to computer through and beyond the Internet via modems on 
telephone lines For many early networks such as UUCPNET FidoNet and BITNET lists of machines 
that were open relays were a core part of those Filtering and speed of email 
delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational 
servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the 
transfer of commercial In the with the rise of spamming spammers resorted to rerouting their 
email through third party email servers to avoid and to exploit the additional resources of 
these open relay servers Spammers would send one email to the open relay and effectively 
include a large blind carbon copy list then the open relay would relay that spam 
to the entire While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time 
when Internet connections were limited it forced each spam to be an exact copy and 
thus easier to detect After abuse by spammers became widespread operating an open relay came 
to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent Open 
relays are recommended against in RFC and RFC which defines SMTP The exact copy nature 
of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk email detection systems such 
as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse To counter this spammers were forced to 
switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using 
open relays was removed since every copy of spam was "unique" and had to be 
sent individually Since open mail relays make no effort to authenticate the sender of an 
email open mail relays are vulnerable to address Many Internet service providers use Domain Name 
Systembased Blackhole Lists DNSBL to disallow mail from open relays Once a mail server is 
detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them they will be 
added to one or more such lists and other email servers using those lists will 
reject any mail coming from those sites The relay need not actually be used for 
sending spam to be blacklisted; instead it may be blacklisted after a vsimple test that 
just confirms open This trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays 
from over down to well under over several This led spammers to adopt other techniques 
such as the use of botnets of zombie computers to send spam One consequence of 
the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain 
Internet service providers To allow customers to use their email addresses at Internet locations other 
than the company's systems such as at school or work many mail sites explicitly allowed 
open relaying so that customers could send email via the ISP from any Once open 
relay became unacceptable because of abuse and unusable because of blocking of open relays ISPs 
and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail 
These include smart hosts SMTPAUTH POP before SMTP and the use of virtual private networks 
VPNs The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF has written a best current practices covering Email 
Submission Operations in RFC Note that the above only becomes an issue if the user 
wishes to or has to continue to send email remotely using the same SMTP server 
which they were previously accessing locally If they have valid access to some other SMTP 
server from their new remote location then they will typically be able to use that 
new server to send emails as if from their old address even when this server 
is properly secured Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's email client which 
may not be entirely straightforward The CANSPAM Act of makes it illegal to send spam 
through an open relay in the United States but makes no provision on their use 
for personal email or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been 
The most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John who argues 
that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue His server is included 
on many open relay blacklists many of which are generated by "automatic detection" that is 
by antispam blacklisters sending an unsolicited test email to other servers to see if they 
will be relayed These measures cause much of his outgoing email to be Along with 
his further deliberate configuration of the server his open relay enables people to send email 
without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send email anonymously 
In his open relay along with others was used by a computer worm to propagate 
John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and 
spamming but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution 
of the new next generation technologies They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that 
some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past preventing transferring of 
computer data rather than In order not to be considered "open" an email relay should 
be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages details will vary 
from system to system — in particular further restrictions may well In particular a properly secured 
SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary emails from nonlocal IP addresses to 
nonlocal mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user In general any other rules an administrator 
chooses to enforce for instance based on what an email gives as its own envelope 
from address must be in addition to rather than instead of the If not the 
relay is still effectively open for instance by the above rules it is easy to 
forge email header and envelope information it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP 
address in a TCPIP transaction because of the threeway handshake that occurs as a connection 
is started Open relays have also resulted from security flaws in software rather than misconfiguration 
by system In these cases security patches need to be applied to close the relay 
Internet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose because spammers have 
created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability The number 
of clients under spammers' control is now so great that previous antispam countermeasures that focused

Nadia Oxford of Gamezebo scored the game stars commending the art music and story but 
criticizing the slow pace and lack of player interaction Andrew Barker of RPGFan scored the 
game saying that while the art was good and the setting and characters showed promise 
the game is "held back" by its short length and he recommended players to hold

Cambodian names usually consist of two elements including a patronymic which serves as a common 
family name for siblings followed by a given Surname then given name Eastern name order 
An example is famous singer Sin Sisamouth his surname last name is Sin and his 
given name first name is Sisamouth In Western sources the two are sometimes Traditionally the 
Khmer do not have Westernstyle family names shared by multiple generations or entire families Instead 
Khmer children use their father's given name as their family Other Austroasiatic indigenous people groups 
within Cambodia have similar naming customs while the SinoKhmer and VietKhmer may follow Chinese and 
Vietnamese naming patterns respectively Chams in Cambodia may have either Khmer or Cham names or 
a combination of both Cham name order is the reverse of the Khmer; the given 
name is followed by the father's given Generally women are given names relating to beauty 
while men are given names of Some Cambodian given names are unisex names Surnames are 
usually taken from the surname or the given name of the and are generally Cambodian 
surnames are sometimes identical to Chinese or Vietnamese Women keep their maiden names after The 
meanings of Cambodian names are generally very simple and reference positive attributes Cambodian people are 
called by their given names without a title informal or by their given names with 
a title formal; the full name including both family name and given name is often 
Surnames are used as a form of address however in the case of names that 
originated as revolutionary aliasesclarification needed Different naming traditions exist among ethnic groups other than the 
Khmer majority The Cambodian population is Buddhist and names are often taken from Buddhism Among 
the Muslim minority Arabic names are often used as family Khmer names are usually pronounced 
with the stress emphasis placed on the last Khmer uses a glottal stop the Cockney 
stop in "ten green bo'les" and other stops p t c and k which may 
or may not occur with aspiration In romanizations of Khmer script aspiration ie a breath

Khmer "family" names are usually simply their father's given name and as such change with 
each generation Other ethnic groups particularly ChineseCambodians and VietnameseCambodians may have a family name that 
is taken by each generation in which case the name is pronounced similarly to the 
language of origin but within the bounds of Khmer phonology Below is a list of 
some common family some of which are also found as given names Unlike Cambodian family 
names given names may have multiple syllables and differ greatly Given names were influenced greatly

Shadow noise or luminescence noise is an effect that digital lightening has on an image 
specifically on the darker or shadowed areas of the image Brightening the image especially in 
underexposed photos brings out the "shadow noise" in such areas Noise in digital photography is 
the analog to film photography's grain or visible distortion that appears on an image However 
film grain tends to be less noticeable than noise which can appear as distorted colors 
or artifacts on an image A suitable analogy would be when a television begins to 
"snow" or experience "white noise" when static begins to appear on the screen distorting or 
obscuring the image There are methods to correct shadow noise Professional digital editing software like 
Photoshop have the capability to eliminate some amount of noise while other software such as 
Band Aide or Noise Ninja are specifically designed around the process of eliminating shadow noise

Noel Counihan October July was an Australian social realist painter printmaker cartoonist and illustrator active 
in the and in Melbourne An atheist communist and art activist Counihan made art in 
response to the politics and social hardships of his times He is regarded as one 
of Australia's major artists of the Counihan was born on October in Albert Park then 
a workingclass suburb of Melbourne He attended the St Paul's Cathedral Melbourne Choir school closed 
in then Caulfield Grammar School in He studied parttime under Charles Wheeler at the National 
Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne during where he met the social realists Herbert 
McClintock and Roy Dalgarno Social realism the belief that art should reflect the realities of 
society under capitalism was the artistic doctrine of the Communist Party of Australia and in 
Counihan became a confirmed atheist and a member of the Party He helped found the 
Workers Art Guild and began printmaking producing linocuts and lithographs for Communist magazine covers and 
pamphlets as well as designing banners During the Great Depression Counihan participated in the "free 
speech" fights in Brunswick organised by the Communist Party in response to a Victorian state 
government law banning "subversive" gatherings Dozens of members of the Unemployed Workers Movement were arrested 
and unemployed meetings at the intersection of Phoenix Street and Sydney Road Brunswick were dispersed 
by police As part of this fight a young Counihan addressed a crowd from a 
locked cage on top a truck Police had to cut him out to the jeers 
of the crowd as he continued speaking From Counihan worked as a cartoonist for various 
publications including The Bulletin and the Communist Party's paper the Guardian from to and again 
from to He spent extended periods in hospital with tuberculosis during the Second World War 
With the encouragement of the artist Yosl Bergner he began to paint He developed a 
personal style based on the social realist approach producing compassionate images of workers and their 
working lives Counihan maintained that the artist had a duty to "gather information from the 
political developments of the time" His painting On Parliament Steps won the George Crouch Memorial 
Prize in Counihan remained loyal to the Communist Party during its various splits and despite 
its declining support in the and His posthumous portrait of Hugh Gemmell LambSmith — who 
had taught Counihan at Caulfield Grammar and as well had encouraged his artistic endeavours whilst 
he was there — largely painted from memory and commissioned by the Caulfield Grammarians' Association 
is on permanent display within the school's "Cripps Centre" on its Caulfield In Counihan contributed

Carnitine Oacetyltransferase also called carnitine acetyltransferase CRAT or EC is an enzyme that encoded by 
the CRAT gene that catalyzes the chemical reaction where the acetyl group displaces the hydrogen 
atom in the central hydroxyl group of Thus the two substrates of this enzyme are 
acetylCoA and carnitine whereas its two products are CoA and Oacetylcarnitine The reaction is highly 
reversible and does not depend on the order in which substrates Different subcellular localizations of 
the CRAT mRNAs are thought to result from alternative splicing of the CRAT gene suggested 
by the divergent sequences in the region of peroxisomal and mitochondrial CRAT cDNAs and the 
location of an intron where the sequences diverge The alternatively splicing of this gene results 
in three distinct isoforms one of which contains an Nterminal mitochondrial transit peptide and has 
been shown to be located in This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases to 
be specific those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups The systematic name of this 
enzyme class is acetylCoAcarnitine Oacetyltransferase Other names in common use include acetylCoAcarnitine Oacetyltransferase acetylcarnitine transferase 
carnitine acetyl coenzyme A transferase carnitine acetylase carnitine acetyltransferase carnitineacetylCoA transferase and CATC This enzyme 
participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism In general carnitine acetyltransferases have molecular weights of about 
kDa and contain approximately CRAT contains two domains an N domain and a C domain 
and is composed of α helices and β strands The N domain consists of an 
eightstranded β sheet flanked on both sides by eight α helices A sixstranded mixed β 
sheet and eleven α helices comprise the enzyme’s C domain When compared the cores of 
the two domains reflect significantly similar peptide backbone folding This occurs despite the fact that 
only of the amino acids that comprise those peptide backbones corresponds to one is the 
catalytic residue in It is located at the interface between the enzyme’s C and N 
domains towards the heart of CRAT is accessible via two Å channels that approach the 
residue from opposite ends of the CRAT enzyme These channels are utilized by the substrates 
of CRAT one channel for carnitine and one for CoA The side chain of is 
positioned irregularly with the ring nitrogen hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen on the amino 
acid Due to the fact that CRAT binds CoA rather than acetylCoA it appears that 
CRAT possesses the ability to hydrolyze acetylCoA before interacting with the lone CoA fragment at 
the binding CoA is bound in a linear conformation with its pantothenic arm binding at 
the active site Here the pantothenic arm’s terminal thiol group and the nitrogen on the 
catalytic side chain form a hydrogen bond The on CoA forms interactions with residues and 
Also at the binding site the residues and form a direct hydrogen bond to one 
another If either residue exhibits a mutation can result in a decrease in CRAT Carnitine 
binds to CRAT in a partially folded state with its hydroxyl group and carboxyl group 
facing opposite directions The site itself is composed of the C domain β sheet and 
particular residues from the N domain Upon binding a face of carnitine is left exposed 
to the space outside the enzyme Like CoA carnitine forms a hydrogen bond with the 
nitrogen on In the case of carnitine the bond is formed with its group This 
CRAT catalysis is stereospecific for carnitine as the stereoisomer of the group cannot sufficiently interact 
with the CRAT carnitine binding site CRAT undergoes minor conformational changes upon binding with The 
residue at the active site of CRAT acts as a base that is able to 
deprotonate the CoA thiol group or the Carnitine group depending on the direction of the 
reaction The structure of CRAT optimizes this reaction by causing direct hydrogen bonding between the 
and both substrates The deprotonated group is now free to attack the acetyl group of 
acetylCoA or acetylcarnitine at its carbonyl site The reaction proceeds directly without the formation of 
a intermediate It is possible for catalysis to occur with only one of the two 
substrates If either acetylCoA or acetylcarnitine binds to CRAT a water molecule may fill the 
other binding site and act as an acetyl group acceptor The literature suggests that the 
trimethylammonium group on carnitine may be a crucial factor in CRAT catalysis This group exhibits 
a positive charge that stabilizes the oxyanion in the reaction’s intermediate This idea is supported 
by the fact the positive charge of carnitine is unnecessary for active site binding but 
vital for the catalysis to proceed This has been proven to be the case through 
the synthesis of a carnitine analog lacking its trimethylammonium group This compound was able to 
compete with carnitine in binding to CRAT but was unable to induce a The emergence 
of subtrateassisted catalysis has opened up new strategies for increasing synthetic substrate There is evidence 
that suggests that CRAT activity is necessary for the cell cycle to proceed from the 
phase to the S Those with an inherited deficiency in CRAT activity are at risk 
for developing severe heart and neurological Reduced CRAT activity can be found in individuals suffering 
from Alzheimer’s CRAT and its family of enzymes have great potential as targets for developing

Antonio Sartorio – December was an Italian composer active mainly in Venice Italy and in 
Hanover Germany He was a leading composer of operas in his native Venice in the 
and and was also known for composing in other genres of vocal music Between and 
he spent most of his time in Hanover where he held the post of Kapellmeister 
to Duke Johann Friedrich of BrunswickLüneburg – returning frequently to Venice to compose operas for 
the Carnival In he became vice maestro di capella at San Marco in Venice Sartorio 
was the brother of composer and organist Gasparo Sartorio and architect Girolamo Sartorio who also 
had connections with the theatre Beyond birth records the first known information about Sartorio relates 
to the mounting of his first opera Gl'amori infruttuosi di Pirro at the Teatro di 
San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice on January His second opera Seleuco did not come until 
five years later when it was produced at the Teatro San Luca on January The 
year before he had been appointed to the position of Kapellmeister to Duke Johann Friedrich 
of BrunswickLüneburg; just months after the duke had assumed authority over the Principality of Calenberg 
upon his elder brother Georg Wilhelm's inheriting of the Principality of Lüneburg Friedrich ruled over 
the Calenberg subdivision of the duchy from until his death in fourteen years later Friedrich 
was a highly intelligent and educated sovereign who had converted to Roman Catholicism in Upon 
becoming duke he instituted the Catholic rite to his court which accordingly led to his 
choice of Sartorio a Catholic as Kapellmeister The duke had met Sartorio upon one of 
his four visits to Italy one of which was for the purpose of lending the 
Republic of Venice substantial military aid against the Turks Sartorio began his duties as Kapellmeister 
on Trinity Sunday not too long after the Duke's new palace in Herrenhausen near Hanover 
was finished The palace's design was inspired by the Palace of Versailles and is famous 
for its gardens the Herrenhausen Gardens As Kapellmeister Sartorio had at his disposal six instrumentalists 
and seven or eight singers the majority of which were Italian For the group Sartorio 
composed music for the Kapelle a missa brevis and several vesper psalms and cantatas in 
both the stile antico and the stile moderno In addition the group's repertory included masses 
motets and psalms by Henri Dumont Bonifatio Gratiani and Orazio Tarditi Some of the group's 
music was discovered in in an organ bellows in the village of Hüpede Sartorio worked 
in Hanover up until during which time he returned frequently to Venice in the winter 
both to compose operas for Carnival and to hire musicians for service at court His 
first trip back to his native city was in During this time his remarkable duo 
operas La prosperità d'Elio Seiano and La caduta d'Elio Seiano were produced on January and 
February Originally the librettist Nicolò Minato had intended for the two works to be performed 
on successive evenings but it appears that either Sartorio or the theatre management overturned this 
decision Sartorio's second visit to Venice was for the Carnival of during which his next 
opera L'Ermengarda regina de' longobardi was performed The librettist Pietro Dolfin a friend of both 
Sartorio and Duke Johann Friedrich administered the duke's theatre loges and corresponded regularly with him 
between and Sartorio’s next stay in Venice lasted an entire year from January or February 
to Carnival On February his well known opera L'Adelaide was given for the first time 
The libretto was again by Dolfin who later reworked some of Gissilla's arias into a 
cantata by adding recitatives Sartorio seems to have responded to Dolfin's wish to have the 
recitatives set for a Cantata di Gissilla is extant; it was apparently conceived for a 
pupil of Dolfin's named Lucretia who had sung a role in the opera probably that 
of Gissilla Sartorio was supposed to return to Hanover at the end of the season 
in which L'Adelaide premiered but poor health prevented him from travelling He was further motivated 
to stay by an invitation to write one of two operas to be performed at 
the Teatro di San Luca during the next Carnival season The Duke assented to Sartorio's 
extended stay largely because of a lengthy and persuasive correspondence by Dolfin who expressed concerns 
over Sartorio's physical health and emphasized the honour of being asked to compose the opera 
Sartorio thereupon offered L'Orfeo a variation on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice with comic 
interludes and elaborate subplots featuring such incongruous characters as Hercules Achilles and Thetis This work 
premiered on December For the theatre's second opera of the season Francesco Cavalli was commissioned 
Cavalli was then near the end of a long and successful career as an operatic 
composer However when his newest work Massenzio went into rehearsal it was found unsuitable by 
the theatre managers "for lack of spirited ariettas" They therefore assigned Sartorio the task of 
writing his own music to the same libretto just days before the opera premiered on 
January Sartorio wrote arias and duets to fulfil his assignment After spending two more years 
in Hanover Sartorio left the service of Duke Johann Friedrich permanently in April although he 
still called himself Friedrich's court composer in the manuscripts of his remaining operas and in 
other documents Upon his departure the Duke gave him a gift of thalers and a 
golden chain The two men remained on good terms and corresponded often with each other 
about negotiations with singers or visits on his behalf to cloistered ladies Sartorio settled in 
Venice in taking up residence in the San Giovanni Grisostomo quarter of the city He 
won the position of vice maestro di cappella of the St Mark's Basilica narrowly defeating 
Carlo Grossi for the post and assuming his position there on May A set of 
eightpart psalms for two choirs that he wrote for the basilica were published in notably 
being his only printed volume of music On December his opera Giulio Cesare in Egitto 
premiered in Venice to a resounding success He composed four more operas between and Sartorio 
was supposed to have been visited by Duke Friedrich in early but the duke died 
on December in Augsburg at the start of his fifth journey to Italy Towards the 
end of Sartorio began composing another opera La Flora but he died before he could 
finish the work He had been ill for seven months prior to his death The 
Teatro San Angelo had commissioned La Flora and not wanting to give it up hired 
Marc'Antonio Ziani to finish it The opera was eventually performed at that house as the 
first opera of the new Carnival season Giovanni Legrenzi succeeded him as vice maestro di 
cappella of the St Mark's Basilica There is one recording of Giulio Cesare in Egitto 
conducted by Attilio Cremonesi ORF and also several recordings of L'Orfeo including a live recording

"Stiff Competition" is a song written by Rick Nielsen that first appeared on Cheap Trick's 
album Heaven Tonight It is famous for the sexual double entendres in the lyrics and 
subsequently appeared on live and compilation albums In the UK "Stiff Competition" was the Bside 
to Cheap Trick's second single from Heaven Tonight "California Man" Some of the lyrics to 
"Stiff Competition" express standard love song sentiments such as looking hard in the loved one's 
However many of the lyrics are double and even triple entendres involving Rolling Stone critic 
Mitchell Schneider describes the song as "phallocentric" citing lyrics such as "The bigger they are 
— the harder they Writer Rick Nielsen described it as an "erotic fantasy" stating On 
another occasion Nielsen stated that the song could have been called "The War Song of 
the Marching Penises" and noted that people come up with even more meanings after analyzing 
the Musically the guitar riff is based on that of The Who's "Won't Get Fooled 
In turn the riff from "Stiff Competition" was the basis for that on The Beastie 
Boys' single "She's on Rolling Stone critic Mitchell Schneider also sees a resemblance between the 
harmonies on "Stiff Competition" and those on The Beatles' "I Feel Producer Tom Werman claimed 
that he did little with the song in preparing the Critic Bryan Wawzenek describes "Stiff

The Nigerian political bureau of established by General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida shortly after his successful 
coup was one of the broadest political consultation exercises conducted in Nigerian history The bureau 
was headed by Dr Samuel Joseph Cookey and contained members charged with the responsibility of 
investigating the problems of the failed Nigerian political and democratic institutions collating the sociopolitical views 
of Nigerians and submitting remedies to curtail the perceived shortcomings of the political and economic 
Before the establishment of the bureau Nigeria had undergone two major democratic experiments replete with 
institutional failures However this did not quench the demand for a return to democracy after 
what was perceived as a relapse to authoritarian tendencies during the administration of General Muhammadu 
Buhari During the bureau's tenure it received over submissions from Nigerians all over the country 
on issues ranging from Religion to ethnicity and ideology At the end of its tenure 
the bureau submitted recommendations to the military governments However the political bureau was seen by 
some critics as an endeavor to legitimize the military's incursion to power by basing some 
of its existence to a return to democratic rule such as open debates and finalizing 
a return to democracy In Newswatch magazine released an unofficial report of the bureau for 
its reward it was proscribed for a few lending credence to some of the criticisms 
of the regime as taking Nigerian on a farcical democratic experiment General Babangida announced the 
names of the seventeen members of the Political Bureau at the inauguration of the bureau 
in Abuja on January The formation of the political bureau was a significant event for 
many reasons The composition of the bureau could hardly be faulted as it included men 
and women of character and learning; it also served as an early move for Babangida 
to coopt cultivate and involve intellectuals in the elaborate Transition to civil rule Programme In 
preparation Babangida released political detainees repealed the Decree of and promised a respect for fundamental 
human rights Within two years of seizing the reins of government Babangida had the support 
of a large swathe of the country; there were few dissensions When it started to 
be obvious to discerning members of the bureau that all was not well with Babangida's 
plans only a few of the members took decisive action Dr Edwin Madunagu then of 
the respected liberal newspaper The Guardian was dropped from the bureau for "extremist" and "uncooperative" 
views and attitudes He would later famously issue a separate report Reports appeared showing that 
Madunagu had been threatened and harassed Professor Sam E Oyovbaire served as special adviser to 
Admiral Aikhomu Aikhomu became Babangida's deputy after Commodore Ebitu Okoh Ukiwe had been forced out 
of office in October engaged in rationalising the regime's political programme Oyovbaire extolled the virtues 
of the Transition Programme the National Electoral Commission NEC MAMSER Mass Mobilisation for SelfReliance Social 
Justice and Economic Recovery SAP Structural Adjustment Programme the "homegrown" version implemented by the Babangida 
regime without the standby facility of the International Monetary Fund In February Oyovbaire along with 
Chidi Amuta wrote in defence of Babangida's In when Babangida had again nursed the ambition 
of contesting for the presidency Professor Oyovbaire had been named as his "Director of Policy 
and Strategy" In December when Badangida had been ruled out of the elections Oyovbaire had 
been reported as the head of the Abubakar Atiku campaign for the presidency in the 
SouthSouth; this followed the " harmonization process of the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Gusau Atiku and 
Saraki Campaign Teams in the SouthSouth following the adoption of Atiku Abubakar as the consensus 
Candidate by the Ciroma led wise men from the North These above appear to confirm 
the reading of public commentators including intellectuals and academics of the success of Babangida's patronage 
politics The creation of several programmes maintained a steady income for many academics even as 
the programs were rife with the corruption that marked Babangida's regime as exceptional Members of 
the political bureau were promised active roles in the implementation of their recommendations; personal loyalty 
developed as a matter of course In reference to the Transition Program of General Babangida 
Prof Adebayo Willians in "Intellectuals and the crisis of democratization in Nigeria Towards a theory 
of postcolonial anomie" wrote "A substantial faction of the intellectual class is implicated in this 
democratic debacle and its behaviour provides rich insights into the dynamics of intellectual affiliations in 
a neopatrimonial military state" By Oyovbaire could be read defending Babangida's regime "The socioeconomic reforms 
of the IBB regime created the enabling environment for a generation of Nigerian professionals who 
were selfreliant confident and challenged to break new grounds in the Nigerian political economy" and 
presented Babangida's regime as the " architect and founder of the process of modernization of 
the Nigerian political economy" Regarding the "missing" Billion Gulf War oilwindfall Oyovbaaire wrote "The IBB 
regime did what it had to do with the dedicated funds Therefore the divergence of 
opinions between the Okigbo committee and the IBB regime on this matter was essentially conceptual 
and not substantive" By Oyovbaire had become coordinator for the activities of PDP presidential aspirant 
Abubakar Atiku Oyovbaire has also coauthored a book "Portrait of a New Nigeria Leader Selected 
Speeches of IBB" Tunji Olagunju and Sam Oyovabaire In the preface Adele Jinadu wrote "President 
Babangida's enunciation of human rights as a cardinal aspect of his regime is not merely 
accidental or an opportunistic rationalisation to take advantage of the opprobrium in which the Buhari 
regime was held and thereby win popular acclaim Rather it runs deep in his liberal 
and populist convictions and is based on a reasoned and wellthought out conceptualisation of the 
military role in African politics" Jinadu another Nigerian intellectual appears blind to as Williams would 
write the "unprecedented and welldocumented assault on human rights by the Babangida government" Oyovbaire's high 
opinion of Babangida could be contrasted with the assessment of two other scholars In the 
assessment of Rotimi and Julius Ihonvbere "Babangida’s Character left much to be desired He was

The Confederation Line French Ligne de la Confédération is a light rail line operated by 
OC Transpo in Ottawa Ontario Canada as part of the city's OTrain light rail system 
The Confederation Line opened on September it is the second OTrain line opened operating on 
an east to west route to complement the north to south Trillium Using light rail 
rolling stock and technology eg pantograph electrical pickup from overhead catenary rather than a third 
rail the Confederation Line is completely grade separated The project was approved by the Ottawa 
City Council and the contract was awarded in December Construction began in Mayor Jim Watson 
announced that the line would open on September At a cost of just over it 
was the largest infrastructure project awarded in the history of the city before being surpassed 
by the Stage extension of the line which will cost The line was approved unanimously 
by the City Council on December after many years of debate on a rapid transit 
network for the city It represents the initial phase of the network and will be 
implemented through a DesignBuildFinanceMaintenance agreement with the Rideau Transit The Citadis Spirit light train will 
be used to provide passenger service On June a sinkhole opened in the middle of 
Rideau Street near its intersection with Sussex Drive metres above the LRT tunnel construction swallowing 
three lanes of the street and a parked van The collapse forced evacuation of the 
Rideau Centre and the closing of a number of local streets and businesses; no one 
was injured or killed but the nearlycompleted tunnel was flooded submerging a roadheader Repairs were 
and the city was cleared of any Testing of the line's rolling stock began in 
late and was planned to continue through most of the following year before the line 
was expected to open to the public in November In September it was announced that 
the line would not open on schedule and would instead open in early In March 
this was pushed back to sometime between April and June In May the opening of 
the line was again delayed until the third quarter of due to concerns about train 
Rideau Transit Group failed to complete testing and hand over the system by the latest 
revised deadline of August the fourth time RTG did not meet a deadline it had 
revised with the OC Transpo announced on August that the testing had been completed by 
RTG and the Confederation Line would open to the public on September On March Ottawa 
City Council issued a notice of default to RTG listing the flaws and problems with 
the line and its Among the cited issues were a shortage of trains during rush 
hour a maintenance facility fire inadequate heating of train operator cars and vehicle parts coming 
loose the latter causing damage to The Confederation Line runs from Tunney's Pasture station in 
the west to Blair station in the east a distance of kilometres including a tunnel 
running under Queen Street in the central business district including under the Rideau The line 
connects to the existing Transitway at both ends and to the OTrain Trillium Line at 
Bayview With complete grade separation travel time from one end to another is less than 
Train frequency is every minutes or better during peak hours and every minutes or better 
after except Sunday The hours of operation for the Confederation Line There is no synchonization 
in the schedule for the last Confederation and Trillium line trains at Bayview station As 
of Trillium Line trains stop running just after midnight Monday through Saturday and at on 
Sundays Thus it is possible for a passenger to be stranded at Bayview if trains 
on one line arrive after the last train on the other has There are stations 
in Stage of the project The three downtown subway stations have platforms; the remainder are 
metres with provisions for future expansion All stations display an illuminated red "O" at the 
entrance Every station has fare vending machines selling Presto cards singleride tickets day passes family 
passes and multiday passes; vending machines accept cash debit cards and credit cards Stations have 
an information phone as well as emergency phones for those requiring assistance; vending machines also 
provide a video chat feature Access through the fare gates to station platforms is via 
Presto card UPass STO Multi card barcoded ticket or barcoded bus transfer All Stage stations 
have elevators and nine have escalators Station stairways have a channel for passengers to push 
a bicycle Four of the stations have public The four major transfer stations—Blair Hurdman Bayview 
and Tunney's Pasture—have a farepaid area so that passengers transferring between bus and OTrain do 
not need to go through fare gates uOttawa Tremblay and Cyrville stations do not have 
nearby connecting buses Lyon is the major hub for STO Société de transport de l'Outaouais 
buses connecting with OC Transpo Station design concerns have been raised; shortcomings identified include narrow 
steps that are slippery when wet which have resulted in passenger As part of the 
winning consortium for the project Alstom was awarded a contract to provide Citadis Spirit It 
was the company's first order for modern light rail vehicles in North America competing directly 
with similar models such as the Siemens which was originally ordered for the original extension 
plan for the Trillium Line but was later cancelled Derived from the earlier Citadis Dualis 
tramtrain used in Europe they were manufactured in Alstom's plant in Hornell New York with 
final assembly taking place at Belfast Yard in Signalling on the line is handled by 
Thales' SelTrac semiautomatic communicationbased train control CBTC As part of a contest organized by OC 
Transpo each train set on both the Confederation Line and the Trillium Line was given 
a name that relates to local or Canadian An additional Citadis Spirit vehicles were ordered 
by the city as part of the Stage extension project with assembly beginning in early 
Originally all vehicles were to be assembled in Ottawa like the original order; however in 
July Alstom announced it would move the assembly of the last vehicles from this order 
to their new plant in The system encountered operational problems with the train set during 
winter storms during early testing including heating systems failing to work communications systems failing and 
body work on cars dropping By early October the automated doors of the Spirit vehicles 
experienced issues with jamming if pushed or held back by passengers; this resulted in service 
disruptions of up to minutes Also if the onboard computer for a train in service 
needed to be rebooted a delay of minutes would Starting in late the Spirit vehicles 
experienced increasingly frequent reliability and availability issues On December the trains failed on New Year’s 
Eve due to electrical problems caused by dirty train roofs causing disruptions to passengers seeking 
to celebrate downtown and return home via public Throughout January despite a mild winter with 
lesser temperature variations than in Alstom train failure continued switch failures occurred when heating failure 
resulted in stoppage despite a brief winter testing warning about this issue The poor rushhour 
Alstom reliability resulted in numerous Confederation Line users abandoning transit and driving to The Alstom 
trains' heating systems have been reported to be insufficient in Ottawa's subzero winter temperatures forcing 
OC Transpo to consider adding heaters to the At the end of January OC Transpo 
also indicated the Alstom trains may be unsuitable in bad weather especially as conditions vary 
from wet icy rain or rain to subzero On January the Confederation Line reached an 
unprecedented alltime operational low when it was short five trains due to "recurring mechanical and 
electrical issues" Instead of the ten trains projected to run that day only eight or 
nine trains ran due to wheel or other mechanical The Confederation Line is expected to 
field working trains during rush hour Passengers also reported there were initially not enough stability 
straps to hold on to with some resorting to scarves wrapped around bars or other 
means to stabilize themselves during OC Transpo has since ordered and installed more straps blaming 
the initial lack on being unwilling to accept the initially quoted to provide them Ultimately 
the city agency paid to install the additional All cars will be stored at the 
Belfast Yard at Belfast Road with connecting track to the Confederation Line Part of the 
site was an existing OC Transpo facility The yard site was created by combining this 
facility with the properties of a number of private business All existing structures were demolished 
in and the new facilities were completed in The facility has a storage shed maintenance 
facilities and an administration Final assembly for some of the LRVs was completed In midApril 
OC Transpo posted a list of bus route changes as a result of the closure 
of the Transitway between Hurdman station and Blair As a result of the closure many 
new routes are being created such as route and existing routes modified most notably routes 
and Many routes will use new busonly lanes on Highway and several others will be 
altered or shortened to avoid serving the construction area The changes are meant to provide 
extra service to those in areas affected by the Transitway closure and to avoid as 
many delays as possible while construction on the Confederation Line progresses A side project on 
the highway was completed in In November the City of Ottawa released its new transportation 
master which included plans to build kilometres of new rapid transit and new stations This 
also included plans to extend the Confederation Line westward to Bayshore station and to Baseline 
station and eastward to Place d'Orleans station In July the city released a functional report 
on the Stage system which added plans to extend the Confederation Line eastward from Place 
d'Orleans station to Trim station An extension westward to Moodie Drive from Bayshore station was 
announced in February This totals an extension of stations kilometers westward and stations kilometers Stage 
will add a new light maintenance and storage facility along Corkstown Road west of Moodie 
Station Construction began in the second quarter of as the initial line becomes operational The 
full system would be operational by with the extension to Trim operational by The city 
is currently working on finalizing plans for the current gap in service between Dominion station 
and Lincoln Fields station where buses travel on the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway a 
little over kilometres without The plan calls for burying trains for most of the route

Automavision is a cinematic technique invented by Danish director Lars von Trier Developed with the 
intention of limiting human influence in Automavision no cinematographer is actively operating the camera The 
best possible fixed camera position is chosen and then a computer chooses framing by randomly 
tilting panning or zooming the camera In doing so it is not uncommon that the 
actors appear in the shots with a part of their face and head cut from 
the frame With this technique then the blame for any "errors" are entirely attributable to 
a Von Trier described Automavision as "a principle for shooting film developed with the intention 
of limiting human influence by inviting chance in from the cold and thus giving the 
work an idealess surface free of the force of habit and The principle was used 
during filming of the movie The Boss of It All Interviewed by The Guardian in 
von Trier said "For a long time my films have been handheld That has to 
do with the fact that I am a control freak With Automavision the technique was 
that I would frame the picture first and then push a button on the computer 
I was not in control — the computer was in And in a interview with The 
Daily Telegraph von Trier said "If you want bad framing Automavision is the perfect way 
to do it It was rather pleasant to lose control In this case I wanted

van schilderijen Hij maakte grote reizen en omstreeks bezocht hij op eigen initiatief de Nederlandse 
kolonie Suriname Hij bezocht Paramaribo maar ook plantages en dorpen van bosnegers en indianen Hij

Surinam' met daar in een honderdtal van zijn tekeningen Het boek is een journalistiek verslag 
van het land en zijn bevolkingsgroepen met al hun vreemde gebruiken voorwerpen feesten en rituelen

Nederlandstalige versie waarop een jaar later commentaar werd gegeven door Marten Douwes Teenstra die ten 
tijde van het bezoek van Benoit aan Suriname daar woonde en werkte als landbouwadviseur en 
inspecteur van openbare werken In zijn korte commentaar corrigeert hij Benoit op details het aantal 
plantages zou niet precies kloppen en Benoit vergiste zich in het jaartal van een verwoestende

Jacobus Anthonie Meessen Utrecht december – Opsterland november was een Nederlandse fotograaf Hij maakte tussen 
en meer dan portretten en landschapsfoto's van Nederlands Indië het huidige Indonesië Meessen werd in 
Utrecht geboren als de zoon van een timmerman en bedreef in Indië het vak van 
zijn vader Hij keerde terug naar Nederland om in het begin van de jaren te 
trouwen maar reisde in weer af naar de kolonie om het land en zijn bevolking 
te documenteren Zijn werk concentreerde zich vooral in Batavia het huidige Jakarta Java Padang en 
Sumatra maar hij fotografeerde ook Banka Billiton Borneo en Nias Toen Meessen in terugkeerde naar 
Nederland ging hij een kort partnerschap aan met Abraham Vermeulen en begon zijn foto's te 
verspreiden Een select aantal afbeeldingen werd in in een uitbundig versierd album aan Koning Willem 
III geschonken Andere werden door De Bussy in in Parijs en Amsterdam tentoongesteld In zijn 
laatste levensjaren werkte Meessen vooral als architect Verzamelingen van zijn albuminepapieren waarvan sommige met de 
hand gekleurd of geannoteerd zijn zijn in het bezit van vier Nederlandse instituten Meessen werd 
op december in Utrecht geboren als zoon van de timmerman Hermanus Johannes Meessen en diens 
vrouw Megteld De jonge Meessen vertrok in naar Batavia het huidige Jakarta de hoofdstad van 
Nederlands Indië waar hij werkte als Vanaf woonde hij in het Twee jaar later keerde 
hij terug naar Nederland waar hij werkte als inspecteur voor het Bureau voor den Op 
december trouwde hij met Johanna Alida Jansje Steenbeek in Utrecht en het stel woonde twee 
jaar in diezelfde Uit hun huwelijk kwamen drie dochters voort geboren in en De eerste 
Antonia stierf als Meessen en zijn vrouw vertrokken in naar Batavia waar Meessen in een 
fotostudio Hij was een van de weinige fotografen in het Nederlands Indië van de jaren 
tijdgenoten Isidore van Kinsbergen Adolph Schaefer en het bedrijf Woodbury Page bestuurd door Walter B 
Woodbury en James Page waren tevens actief Meessen hoopte uiteindelijk afbeeldingen te produceren van de 
diverse landschappen en volkeren van Indië Van mei tot augustus was hij in Sumatra eerst 
in Padang en later in de Minanghooglanden Daar bood hij zijn fotografiediensten aan waaronder dubbel 
en familieportretten Nadat hij was teruggekeerd naar Batavia opende hij nog een waar hij portretten 
en landschapsfoto's Drie maanden later verkochten Jacobus en Johanna hun bezittingen en verhuisden naar Padang 
waar de Meessens een fotostudio oprichtten In hun biografie van de fotograaf suggereren Mattie Boom 
en Steven Wachlin dat dit waarschijnlijk een financiële overweging was aangezien Meessen wellicht niet kon 
concurreren met Woodbury Page in In november van begon Jacobus met de verkoop van zijn 
eerste album getiteld Sumatra's Het album was gebonden in marokijn en bevatte meer dan landschapsfoto's 
van Padang en de omliggende steden waaronder Padang Panjang en Fort de Vanaf juni bood 
zijn fotostudio workshops en afbeeldingen van noord Sumatra en Nias Meesens fotografische ondernemingen – en de 
resulterende albums – kostten ongeveer NederlandsIndische gulden waaronder camerauitrusting hoewel het niet bekend is welke modellen 
hij gebruikte chemicaliën transport en accommodatie Meessen werkte gedurende zijn verblijf in NederlandsIndië altijd alleen 
en legde het landschap en het volk van de kolonie vast op Tijdens zijn etnografische 
fotografie van de inboorlingen moest Meessen hardnekkig bijgeloof overwinnen Volgens het Bataviaasch Handelsblad gold dat 
"het fanatieke bijgeloof het portretteren van mensen buiten Java bijna onmogelijk Anderen waren enthousiaster waaronder 
de dorpelingen van Nias "Bij aankomst loste ik enkele schoten en hees de Nederlandse vlag 
Spoedig kwamen de dorpelingen me tegemoet en vroegen wat ik wilde Toen ik hun dit 
vertelde beloofden ze mij hulp bij het transporteren van mijn goederen en de volgende ochtend 
om uur stonden er krijgers op mij te wachten op het In juni van keerden 
Meessen en zijn vrouw terug naar Batavia en het jaar daarna verhuisden zij naar Daar 
ging Meessen laat een partnerschap aan met Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen om een nieuwe fotostudio te 
openen genaamd A A Vermeulen Co Ze tekenden een contract voor vijf jaar maar de 
samenwerking stortte in maart van in Boom en Wachlin suggereren dat Vermeulen – vooral bekend om 
zijn portretten – geïnteresseerd was in het uitbreiden van zijn oeuvre met landschappen terwijl Meessen een 
plek nodig had om zijn afbeeldingen uit Indië te drukken en te verkopen Hierdoor was 
Meessen in februari van in staat om een album van zijn beste foto's uit Java 
en Sumatra aan Koning Willem III te Dit album van afbeeldingen was uitbundig versierd met 
zilver en goud en toonde de namen van Java Sumatra Borneo en Nias in de 
hoeken van het voorplat In het midden werden Nederlandse en Bataafse wapens omringd door zilveren 
kokospalmen en De volgende paar jaar ging Meessen door met de verkoop van zijn afbeeldingen 
uit Indië In publiceerde hij een collectie van foto's – waarvan landschappen en portretten – via de 
Amsterdamse uitgever De Bussy; deze collectie werd een Verzameling Fotografien van Nederlandsch Indië genoemd en 
werd voor een prijs van verkocht in een doos van Bij de Exposition Géographique in 
Parijs in stelde hij deze afbeeldingen met veel succes tentoon In een recensie noemde het 
Bataviaasch Handelsblad de onderneming om Indië te documenteren lovenswaardig en sprak de hoop uit dat 
ook foto's van dieren gemaakt zouden kunnen In stelde Meessen zijn werken nogmaals tentoon ditmaal 
op de Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling in Amsterdam Waarschijnlijk heeft hij echter uiteindelijk geen 
winst gemaakt op zijn In de laatste jaren van zijn leven reisde van plaats tot 
plaats en bracht onder andere tijd door in Gorredijk en andere delen van Opsterland in 
Friesland Hij werkte als bouwopzichter en later als gemeentelijk Een van zijn projecten in deze 
functie was een basisschool aan de ZuidWest Dubbelestraat te Gorredijk een neogotisch gebouw – mogelijk geïnspireerd 
door soortgelijke scholen in Raamsdonksveer en Amsterdam – gebouwd om een oudere school te vervangen die 
was Meessen stierf in Opsterland op november drie dagen nadat hij een ziekte had De 
onafgemaakte school werd voltooid door Hidde Petrus Nicolaas In een recensie van Meessens fotografie schrijven 
Boom en Wachlin dat zijn Javaanse afbeeldingen zijn beste foto's zijn en dat die van 
andere eilanden variëren in kwaliteit Ze merken aanzienlijk detail in zijn stadsgezichten op Hij koos 
gebouwen die populair waren onder andere fotografen waaronder Paleis te Rijswijk en de woning van 
Sarief Bastaman Saleh Veel van zijn studioportretten lijken puur commercieel waardoor Boom en Wachlin vermoeden 
dat deze bedoeld waren om Meessens landschapsfotografie te Sommige afbeeldingen waaronder vooral portretten waren Meessens 
foto's uit het album dat hij aan Koning Willem III schonk worden bewaard in de 
Koninklijke Bibliotheek in Den Haag Dit album bevat een reisbeschrijving van Meessens fotografie en afbeeldingen 
van zes eilanden Java Sumatra Banka Billiton Borneo en Nias en diverse etnische groepen waaronder 
de Javanen Chinezen Dajaks en Maleiers Hij geeft commentaar bij een aantal afbeeldingen van mensen 
en schrijft bij een foto van njai concubines "Ze zijn een noodzakelijk kwaad voor het 
leger Ze behouden binnen en buiten de kazerne de discipline en zijn op zeereizen van 
onschatbare Een tweetal foto's een van de rivier Ciliwung in Batavia en een tweede van

van Himmler om met een groep van SSspecialisten het kasteel Wewelsburg op te blazen zodat 
de stichtelijke voorwerpen en belangrijke bestanden niet in de handen van de geallieerden zouden vallen 
Het sloopteam arriveerde op maart Dezelfde dag nadat Macher de lokale brandweer geïnformeerd had dat 
de zuidoost toren minst belangrijke toren van het kasteel opgeblazen was Vanwege het gebrek aan 
explosieve konden ze de rest van het complex niet Marcher gaf het bevel aan de 
brandweer om de brand niet te blussen zodat de rest van het complex alsnog vernietigd 
werd Macher had ook de opdracht gekregen om de kostbaarheden te begraven inclusief de SSEhrenring 
die in een gedenkplaats gehouden werden ter nagedachtenis aan de gesneuvelde SS'ers Deze kostbaarheden zijn 
nooit meer teruggevonden Gedurende de laatste dagen van de Tweede Wereldoorlog reisde Himmler Grothmann en 
Macher van Lübeck naar Flensburg Daar bood Himmler zijn diensten als plaatsvervangendbevelhebber aan aan de

met de geallieerden te beginnen Ontslagen van al zijn functies en ongewenst door zijn voormalige 
collega's probeerde Himmler onder te duiken om zo maar niet gearresteerd te worden Met een 
loonboekje onder de naam van een sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger van de Geheime Feldpolizei wat een 
vergissing was aangezien leden van deze organisatie door de geallieerden gezocht werden Macher en Grothmann 
waren gekleed als Macher Himmler en Grothmann werden gestopt bij een checkpoint die opgezet was 
door voormalige Sovjet krijgsgevangenen en op mei werden ze aangehouden De drie mannen werden op 
mei naar de geallieerden barakken in Lüneburg Tijdens een routine verhoor gaf Himmler toe wie 
hij was daarna op het hoofdkantoor van het Britse Tweede Leger waar dokter Wells een 
medisch onderzoek begon Wells probeerde de mondholte van Himmler te inspecteren maar Himmler trok zijn 
hoofd weg en beet een cyanidecapsule door die in een kies was verborgen Na de 
zelfmoord van Himmler werden Macher en Grothmann gearresteerd In april zocht Macher nog één keer 
de publiciteit en verscheen met zijn voormalige SSofficieren op de begrafenis van Josef Dietrich en

De vorming van de Verenigde Staten van Oostenrijk was een politiek idee uit De bedoeling 
was het keizerrijk OostenrijkHongarije te hervormen onder de Habsburgse monarchie Men wilde onder meer de 
verschillende volkeren een eigen deelstaat geven Hoewel kroonprins Frans Ferdinand nooit officieel in het besturen 
van de dubbelmonarchie OostenrijkHongarije werd betrokken werkte hij actief mee in de keizerlijke politiek Na 
zijn troonsbestijging zou hij de naam Franz II aannemen Men wilde de modernisering van het 
militaire apparaat forceren om de dubbelmonarchie te hervormen het zogenaamde trialisme De hervormingen zouden onder 
meer Kroatië Bosnië en Dalmatië verenigen in één Kroatische deelstaat dit tot ergernis van Servië 
dat ambities had een verenigd ZuidSlavisch koninkrijk onder Servische leiding te realiseren inclusief de Oostenrijkse 
gebieden Kroatië Bosnië Dalmatië en Vojvodina Deze plannen zorgden derhalve voor Servische afkeer tegen Frans 
Ferdinand en de Habsburgers Omgekeerd werd ook de afkeer van de OostenrijkHongaarse burgers en adel 
tegen Servië groter Iets waar de officiële kranten in die tijd graag over schreven was 
de agressieve opstelling van Servië Een veel gehoorde leuze in Oostenrijk in die tijd was 
„Serviërs moeten sterven” Aurel Popovici een Roemeense politicus en jurist stelde in opdracht van Frans 
Ferdinand een plan op van het nieuwe staatsbestel naar het voorbeeld van de Verenigde Staten 
van Amerika de Verenigde Staten van GrootOostenrijk Men noemde dit het trialisme In elk geval 
hadden deze plannen de staatsrechtelijke oplossing van de unie van Hongarije en Kroatië tot gevolg 
gehad iets waar de Hongaren niet blij mee waren geweest Maar Franz Ferdinand ontpopte zich 
daardoor wel tot een gevaarlijke tegenstander bij vele kringen van het hof en jaagde de 
Hongaren en Serviërs tegen zich in het harnas Ondanks zijn hervormingsplannen werd hij nooit een 
populair persoon ook niet in eigen land en bij zijn oom keizer Frans Jozef Het 
trialisme beoogde voor alle volksgroepen autonomie in de vorm van een eigen deelstaat met een 
eigen parlement Bij de oude staatsinrichting waren er maar twee deelstaten Cisleithanië Oostenrijk en Transleithanië 
Hongarije Het gebied Bosnië behoorde tot geen van de landsdelen en werd centraal bestuurd als 
bezet gebied op de kaart buiten het rijk Deze twee landsdelen bepaalden zelf de mate 
van autonomie van de lagere bestuurseenheden De autonomie van de kroonlanden de gebieden van Oostenrijks 
Cisleithanië was overal erg beperkt In Hongaars Transleithanië was de situatie ingewikkelder; vóór de Ausgleich 
van was bijvoorbeeld Transsylvanië nog een gelijkberechtigd kroonland Alle gebieden inclusief Hongarije waren toen trouwens 
nog kroonland die direct onder de centrale regering stonden Na de Ausgleich werd de term 
kroonland in Hongarije afgeschaft De Ausgleich had dus tot gevolg dat Transsylvanië bij Transleithanië werd 
ingedeeld Prompt deelden de Hongaren Transsylvanië in bij het koninkrijk Hongarije en niet als apart 
koninkrijk of vorstendom zoals dat met Fiume en Kroatië en Slavonië wel gebeurde Uiteraard tot 
groot ongenoegen van de daar wonende Roemenen Ook werd er door de Hongaren weleens getornd 
aan de autonomie van de andere gebieden van Transleithanië zoals die van Kroatië Aan deze 
situatie zouden de plannen van Frans Ferdinand een einde maken de twee landsdelen én de 
kroonlanden en bestuurlijke gebieden van Transleithanië zouden vervangen worden door deelstaten met dezelfde bevoegdheden als 
de oude landsdelen Cisleithanië en Transleithanië Dat dit idee werd toegejuicht door de verschillende volken

Het Campeonato Amapaense is het staatskampioenschap voetbal van de Braziliaanse staat Amapá De staat Amapá 
bevindt zich voor het overgrote deel in Amazonegebied en is dunbevolkt Hierdoor zijn er maar 
weinig voetbalclubs en staat de staat altijd van onder in de CBFranking In zakte de 
club zelfs naar de voorlaatste plaats Deze lage klassering gaf tot slechts één ploeg uit 
de staat het recht op een plek in de eerste ronde van de nationale Série 
D sinds zijn dit er twee De statelijke bond FAF bepaalt welke ploegen dit zijn 
Het kampioenschap van Amapá vindt plaats sinds Pas in werd het kampioenschap geprofessionaliseerd Tot en 
met was dit niet mogelijk omdat Amapá de status van territorium had in plaats van 
die van een officiële staat Net als de andere staatscompetities in Brazilië wil de competitieopzet 
van het kampioenschap van Amapá nog weleens veranderen Daar de competitie pas laat geprofessionaliseerd werd 
heeft er nooit een club uit Amapá in de Série A of Série B gespeeld 
in de tijd dat alle staten hier nog deelnemers voor mochten leveren In was EC 
Macapá de eerste club van de staat op nationaal niveau in de Série C Van 
tot speelde er elk jaar een club uit de staat in de Série C Ypiranga 
was met vijf seizoenen de club die het vaakst in de Série C speelde Na 
de invoering van de Série D werd het opzet van de Série C nu dat 
van de Série D waardoor de staat elk jaar één deelnemer mag afleveren geen van 
hen kon tot dusver promotie afdwingen naar de Série C Clubs die vetgedrukt staan spelen

De Voorhof is een woonwijk in Delft in de Nederlandse provincie ZuidHolland De wijk met 
veel hoogbouw is een onderdeel van DelftZuid dat ten zuidwesten van het centrum van Delft 
ligt De Voorhof is in de jaren gebouwd De woningdichtheid is door de flats hoog 
De Voorhof is de dichtstbevolkte wijk van Delft en behoort ook tot de wijken van 
Nederland met de meeste woningen per hectare VoorhofHoogbouw heeft een van de hoogste bevolkingsdichtheden van 
Nederland Ongeveer is huurwoning koopwoning De Voorhof wordt aan de noordkant begrensd door de Westlandseweg 
aan de zuidkant door de Kruithuisweg aan de westkant door de Beatrixlaan en aan de 
oostkant door het spoor Midden in de buurt bevindt zich het winkelcentrum De Hoven Passage 
Het hoge kantoorgebouw Torenhove met verdiepingen ligt aan dit winkelcentrum In de Voorhof wonen in 
vergelijking met andere wijken veel mensen met een recente migratieachtergrond De Voorhof kan dus worden 
gezien als een migrantenwijk Ongeveer de helft van de bevolking is van volledig Nederlandse afkomst 
Er staan twee kerken in de Voorhof de Adelbertkerk en de Marcuskerk Een gedeelte van 
Voorhof staat bekend als de Poptahof dat aan de noordzijde van de wijk ligt De 
Poptahof wordt ingesloten door vier belangrijke wegen de Papsouwselaan Martinus Nijhofflaan Prinses Beatrixlaan en Westlandseweg 
Winkelcentrum In de Hoven ligt tegen de Martinus Nijhofflaan aan De Poptahof is net zoals 
de andere delen van de Voorhof in de jaren gebouwd Het bestaat hoofdzakelijk uit een 
achttal flats met elf verdiepingen De woningen zijn vooral bestemd voor de huishoudens met lage 
inkomens en bevat een hoge dichtheid aan verschillende nationaliteiten Opdracht tot de bouw van de 
wijk werd gegeven door de toenmalige Algemene Woningbouwvereniging Volkshuisvesting AWV in Delft die de architect 
SJ van Embden inhuurde om een woonbuurt te ontwikkelen in het toen populaire concept van 
de Functionele Stad Hoogbouw deed daarmee zijn intrede in Delft De wijk die werd ontwikkeld 
bestond uit ruim duizend woningen Die zijn verdeeld over acht flats van elf verdiepingen vier 
middelhoge flats met vier verdiepingen en een aantal eengezinswoningen In de jaren werd besloten dat 
de woningen in de hoge Poptahofflats niet meer voldeden en er kwamen er plannen voor 
renovatie van de wijk De renovatie zou bestaan uit het creëren van meer open ruimte 
door het slopen van de laagbouwflats en het volledig verbouwen van de hoogbouw De laagbouwflats 
werden begin eeuw gesloopt Het strippen van de eerste hoogbouwflats zou aanvankelijk zo rond het 
jaar beginnen en wel bij de voorste flats Na enkele jaren van uitstel onder meer 
door protest van winkeliers onder de voorste flats van de Poptahof die vervangende winkelpanden eisten 
in de periode dat de voorste flats zouden worden verbouwd werd er vanaf pas begonnen 
met het ontruimen van de eerste flats voor de verbouwing Men begon daarbij uiteindelijk bij 
de achterste flats In werd geschat dat de totale renovatie in zou worden afgerond Een 
deel van de flats werd niet gerenoveerd waardoor de werkzaamheden al eerder in werden afgerond 
Behalve de ingrijpende renovatie van de flats van de Poptahof werden er de jaren voor 
en na nog andere grote werkzaamheden in de Voorhof uitgevoerd Om de verkeersdrukte voor auto's 
te verminderen werd in en de Papsouwselaan opnieuw ingericht met in beide richtingen één rijstrook 
voor auto's Aan de Papsouwselaan werd in een nieuwe parkeergarage gebouwd Deze was nodig voor 
een eventuele uitbreiding van het winkelcentrum In de Hoven De parkeergarage en de herinrichting van 
de Papsouwselaan passen in het kader van de renovatie van de wijk Het centrale verkeersplein 
het Delflandplein werd opnieuw ingericht van een grote kruising tot een rond Op de Martinus 
Nijhofflaan werd op de trambaan gras gelegd Station Delft Zuid werd aan het einde van 
en in opnieuw ingericht Vanaf reed tramlijn tijdelijk niet meer door de Voorhof vanwege de 
werkzaamheden aan de treintunnel door Delft De trams konden niet meer door de Irenetunnel Ongeveer 
een jaar later werd het tramtraject opnieuw in gebruik genomen Xray is een nieuw complex 
langs het spoor voor studentenhuisvesting Het werd aan het einde van geopend Er werden sinds 
aan beide kanten van de Martinus Nijhofflaan nieuwe flats gebouwd met dezelfde architectuur van de 
nieuwe flats als in de Poptahof Er werd begonnen met de bouw van de drie 
flats boven De Hoven Passage pas later ook met de flats aan de andere kant 
van de weg In april is in de Voorhof een beeld geplaatst van de kunstenaar

The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles ook wel bekend als The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones 
is een Amerikaanse televisieserie over de jonge jaren van het personage Indiana Jones De serie 
liep van tot met een totaal van afleveringen De serie werd in Nederland voor het 
laatst uitgezonden op in De serie was gericht op een jong publiek en was derhalve 
ook educatief De hoofdrolspelers waren Sean Patrick Flanery Corey Carrier en George Hall Het succes 
van de serie leidde tot de opnames van vier televisiefilms Tijdens de opnames van de 
eerste drie bioscoopfilms over Indiana Jones kreeg regisseur George Lucas geregeld vragen van de cast 
en crew over Indiana’s verleden Al in de derde film Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade besloten Lucas en zijn collegaregisseur Steven Spielberg iets meer te onthullen over Indiana’s achtergrond 
Zo bevat de film een scène waarin men een jonge Jones te zien krijgt gespeeld 
door River Phoenix Dit leidde uiteindelijk tot het plan om meer films of een serie 
te maken waarin Indiana Jones’s verleden zou worden uitgediept George Lucas schreef een uitgebreide tijdlijn 
voor Indiana Jones waarin hij gedetailleerd gebeurtenissen uit Indiana’s jeugd vastlegde Deze tijdlijn vormde de 
basis voor in totaal afleveringen De tijdlijn begon in en liep door tot aan Raiders 
of the Lost Ark Lucas verwerkte in de tijdlijn ook al belangrijke zaken zoals welke 
plaatsen Indiana zou bezoeken in welk jaar en welke historische personages hij zou ontmoeten Toen 
de serie werd stopgezet waren nog maar van de geplande verhalen verteld Zou de serie 
zijn voortgezet dan waren ook jongere versies van andere personages uit Raiders of the Lost 
Ark geïntroduceerd zoals Abner Ravenwood "Jeruzalem Juni en René Belloq "Honduras December Een groot aantal 
filmmakers werkten mee aan de serie waaronder bekende namen als Frank Darabont Nicolas Roeg Mike 
Newell Deepa Mehta Joe Johnston Jonathan Hensleigh Terry Jones Simon Wincer Carrie Fisher en Vic 
Armstrong De serie was ongewoon in het feit dat alle afleveringen op locatie werden gefilmd 
overal ter wereld Om de kosten die dit met zich meebracht nog deels te reduceren 
werd de serie opgenomen op film in plaats van het gebruikelijke De serie werd zo 
opgenomen dat elke aflevering een opzichzelfstaand verhaal zou vormen en de afleveringen los van elkaar 
te bekijken waren Elke aflevering kostte rond de miljoen dollar om te maken en opnames 
duurden gemiddeld weken De serie werd in drie etappes opgenomen De eerste productie vond plaats 
tussen en bestaande uit afleveringen Hiervan waren er vijf met Indy als kind met Indy 
als tienerjonge volwassene en met allebei De tweede productie vond plaats van tot en bestond 
uit afleveringen een met Indy als kind en met Indy als tienerjonge volwassene De derde 
productie vond plaats van tm en bestond uit de vier televisiefilms De serie werd opgezet 
als een educatief programma voor kinderen en tieners Derhalve hadden vaak historische personages of gebeurtenissen 
een grote rol in de afleveringen De meeste afleveringen volgden een vaste formule waarin de 
inmiddels Indiana Jones terugblikt op zijn jeugd en zijn belevenissen vertelt aan anderen De rest 
van de aflevering toonde Indiana als een kind van een jaar of in de jaren 
of als oudere tiener tijdens de jaren In een aflevering kwam een Indiana voor gespeeld 
door Harrison Ford die ook de rol vertolkte in de vier bioscoopfilms In veel van 
de afleveringen ontmoette Indiana een historisch figuur Zo kreeg men onder andere Leo Tolstoy Lawrence 
of Arabia Theodore Roosevelt Jiddu Krishnamurti Pancho Villa Charles de Gaulle en John Ford te 
zien De serie speelde zich af op verschillende locaties waaronder Egypte OostenrijkHongarije India en China 
De show gaf veel achtergrondinformatie voor de reeds gemaakte films Zo werd Indiana’s relatie met 
zijn vader die voor het eerst te zien was in Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade verder uitgediept Ook Indiana’s jacht op het “Oog van de Pauw” een grote diamant 
die te zien was in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was een regelmatig 
terugkerende plot De serie bestaat uit seizoenen met in totaal afleveringen waarvan er niet zijn 
uitgezonden Nadat de serie werd beëindigd werden er vier televisiefilms gemaakt als poging de serie 
nieuw leven in te blazen In werden de afleveringen en televisiefilms bewerkt tot nieuwe afleveringen 
verdeeld over periodes De naam werd aangepast naar The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones De 
bewerkte afleveringen spelen zich grotendeels in chronologische volgorde af Van tot werd de serie genomineerd 
voor Emmy Awards waarvan hij er won In werd Corey Carrier genomineerd voor de Young 
Artist Award in de categorie "Best Young Actor Starring in a Television Series" In werd 
Solebayplein is een officieuze naam voor een plein in de wijk Landlust in AmsterdamWest Het 
plein ligt tussen de uiteinden van de Solebaystraat en Bos en Lommerweg daar waar zij 
aansluiten op de Haarlemmerweg Tussen de Solebaystraat en Bos en Lommerweg vindt de afsluiting plaats 
in de vorm van een woonblok maar dat woonblok heeft ten opzichte van andere bebouwing 
aan de Haarlemmerweg een teruggetrokken rooilijn Het heeft grotendeels de straatnummering van die Haarlemmerweg Bij 
een algehele opknapbeurt van de omgeving klaagden de bewoners dat zij zich nogal onveilig voelden 
op het pleintje Dit kwam doordat de bomen en struiken licht weghielden De gemeente Amsterdam 
of stadsdeel West vroeg vervolgens aan architectekunstenares Lobke Alkemade het plein opnieuw in te richten 
Zij had eerder voor de gemeente gewerkt met pleinen in AmsterdamOost zoals het Eikenplein Zij 
richtte een open plein in met zitbankjes en een kunstwerk Het woonblok Haarlemmerweg dat de 
zuidkant van het pleintje vormt stamt uit de jaren Het is gebouwd in de stijl 
van de Amsterdamse School en is ontworpen door Gerrit Jan Rutgers Het zijn portiekwoningen waarvan 
de portieken een natuurstenen ingang en trap hebben die richting toegangsdeur overgaat in in baksteen 
Verder valt de strakke indeling van de ramenrijen op Op de begane grond is er 
plaatsgemaakt voor winkeleenheden met een centraal geplaatste deur Een deel van die ondergevels heeft nog 
de originele bovenlichten Op het plein ligt in een grote ronde stenen zitbank of verzamelplaats 
een in hout uitgesneden kaart waarop de zeeslagen staan aangegeven die de naamdragers zijn van 
de straten in deze buurt De Solebaystraat werd in vernoemd naar de Slag bij Solebay

Een metatheorie is een wetenschappelijke theorie die een andere theorie als onderwerp van de studie 
heeft Metatheorieën maken deel uit van het filosofisch georiënteerde deel van een aantal andere disciplines 
met name de epistemologie de metalogica de metawiskunde en de metataal Binnen het kader van 
de metatheorie als zodanig is echter onlangs een geheel nieuwe discipline ontwikkeld die zich speciaal 
met de structuur van holistische systemen bezighoudt de systemica Volgens Stephen Hawking is een theorie 
altijd hypothetisch van aard aangezien ze aan de hand van experimenten nooit bewezen maar wel 
gelogenstraft kan worden Volgens de systemica kan een metatheorie wel betrekking hebben op het standpunt 
of de subjectieve eigenschappen van een andere theorie maar niet op het onderzoeksdomein hiervan Logische 
verklaringen die in metatheorieën worden gedaan met betrekking tot de theorie die bestudeerd wordt worden 
metastellingen genoemd Taxonomie speelt een zeer belangrijke rol in metatheorie doordat het classificeren van theorieën 
een van de onderwerpen is die in een metatheorie centraal staat Men laat het begin 
van de metatheorie in het algemeen samenvallen met het ontstaan van de metawiskunde waar David 
Hilbert in de fundamenten voor legde door een manier om de consistentie van de wiskunde 
te bewijzen voor te stellen In bewees Kurt Gödel met zijn onvolledigheidsstellingen dat dit ideaal 
in werkelijkheid niet te realiseren is maar niettemin had Hilbert met zijn voorstel de aanzet 
tot de ontwikkeling van zowel de metawiskunde als de metatheorie gegeven De metatheorie is daarna

Het Grenswisselkantoorarrest of kortweg GWKarrest is een belangrijk arrest van de Nederlandse Hoge Raad HR 
september NJ Dit arrest en het eerder gewezen Citoarrest zijn standaardarresten met betrekking tot de 
grens tussen voorbereidingshandeling en begin van uitvoering bij poging tot het plegen van een misdrijf 
Twee mannen waren van plan om het filiaal van het Grenswisselkantoor in Bladel te overvallen 
Ze hadden allerlei voorbereidingen getroffen en zaten in hun auto te wachten op de komst 
van de eerste bankemployee om toe te slaan als deze de deur van het bankkantoor 
zou openen Deze man kreeg echter argwaan en waarschuwde de politie toen hij op de 
parkeerplaats dezelfde auto zag staan als een dag eerder Toen de politie verscheen sloegen de 
overvallers op de vlucht Na een wilde achtervolging werden ze ingerekend De voorbereidingen waren zeer 
uitgebreid Verdachten reden in een gestolen auto met gestolen kentekenplaten naar het Grenswisselkantoor Daar stond 
de auto met draaiende motor te wachten op komst van de bankemployee In hun auto 
lag een geladen dubbelloops jachtgeweer een imitatie handvuurwapen alsook handboeien touw en tape om de 
bankemployee te knevelen De mannen droegen dubbele kleding en hadden pruiken bij zich Uitvoeringshandeling Heeft 
het voornemen van de daders om een misdrijf te plegen zich door een begin van 
uitvoering geopenbaard Nee De vordering door de officier van justitie tot inbewaringstelling van een van 
de twee verdachten werd door de rechtercommissaris afgewezen Deze beschikking is in hoger beroep door 
de raadkamer van de rechtbank bevestigd Het cassatieberoep van de officier van justitie is door 
de Hoge Raad verworpen De rechtbank overwoog dat niet is gebleken dat er sprake is 
van enig begin van uitvoering nu verdachten in de auto zijn blijven zitten en geen 
enkele verdere actie ter uitvoering van hun voornemen hebben ondernomen De Hoge Raad oordeelde dat 
een begin van uitvoering van het voorgenomen misdrijf afpersing artikel Sr ontbrak Het voornemen van 
de daders had zich niet door een begin van uitvoering geopenbaard Immers wanneer iemand het 
voornemen heeft opgevat een bank te overvallen kan niet worden gezegd dat hij aan het 
misdrijf begin van uitvoering heeft gegeven indien hij zich met een auto naar die bank 
heeft begeven doch –om welke reden dan ook– die auto niet heeft verlaten noch –in 
of vanuit die auto– een gedraging heeft verricht welke naar haar uiterlijke verschijningsvorm moet worden 
beschouwd als te zijn gericht op de voltooiing van dat voorgenomen misdrijf De definitie van 
strafbare poging art omvat vier elementen Een gedraging is als begin van uitvoering van een 
voorgenomen misdrijf aan te merken « als zij naar haar uiterlijke verschijningsvorm moet worden beschouwd als 
te zijn gericht op de voltooiing van het misdrijf» Dit is het Citocriterium dat door 
de Hoge Raad werd geïntroduceerd in het Citoarrest waarin een gedraging van de dader aanbellen 
werd aangemerkt als begin van uitvoering waardoor het voornemen van de dader zich heeft geopenbaard 
In de casus van het Grenswisselkantoorarrest zag de Hoge Raad géén begin van uitvoering zodat 
de verdachten vrijuit gingen althans wat betreft de aanklacht van poging tot afpersing lees gewapende 
bankoverval Dit zou wellicht anders zijn geweest als de bankemployee een jachtgeweer had gezien De 
kritiek op dit arrest heeft geleid tot een nieuw artikel Sr dat bij zeer ernstige

Lev Ivanovitsj Jasjin Russisch Лев Иванович Яшин Bogorodskoje nabij Moskou oktober – Moskou maart was 
een SovjetRussisch doelman Hij wordt door velen beschouwd als de beste doelman aller tijden wegens 
zijn lenigheid indrukwekkende figuur en snelle reflexen Jasjin is geboren in Moskou en kwam uit 
een arbeidersfamilie Op zijn twaalfde levensjaar begon hij al te werken in de metaalbewerking Zijn 
hele voetballoopbaan die van tot liep speelde Jasjin voor Dinamo Moskou Hij won in die 
tijd vijf keer het Sovjet kampioenschap en drie keer de beker In won hij bovendien 
het Sovjet kampioenschap ijshockey voor Dinamo nadat hij zichzelf maar niet in de basis van 
het voetbalteam kon spelen Jasjins grootste rivaal was Khomich die ook de keeper van het 
Sovjetteam was Ze speelden allebei bij dezelfde club maar Khomich had al een reputatie opgebouwd 
voordat Jasjin in beeld kwam en lange tijd moest hij dus genoegen nemen met een 
tweede plaats Met Dinamo Moskou won hij vijfmaal het Sovjetlandskampioenschap en werd verder keer tweede 
en één keer derde Jasjin is de enige keeper die ooit gekozen is tot Europees 
voetballer van het jaar Naar verluidt heeft hij in zijn carrière bovendien rond de penalty's 
gestopt; veel meer dan welke andere professionele doelman in de geschiedenis van het voetbal Het 
geheim achter zijn talent om penalty's te stoppen omschreef Jasjin als volgt "Een sigaretje om 
rustig te worden en dan een borreltje om je spieren klaar te maken" Voor bewezen 
diensten ontving Lev Jasjin de 'Orde van Lenin' de op één na hoogste onderscheiding in 
de SovjetUnie In speelde Jasjin zijn afscheidswedstrijd uitkomend voor zijn club Dinamo Moskou tegen een 
verzameling Europese sterren Lev Jasjin testemonial voor de FIFA werd in het Lenin Stadion in 
Moskou gespeeld Zo'n toeschouwers zagen een wedstrijd met grote sterren als Pelé Eusébio en Franz 
Beckenbauer In werd Jasjin uiteindelijk voor het eerst opgeroepen voor het nationale team Hij zou 
in totaal wedstrijden spelen en in die tijd goud winnen op de Olympische Spelen van 
en het allereerste Europees Kampioenschap winnen Hij deed met zijn land mee aan drie WK's 
namelijk die van en In ging Jasjin wederom mee maar als derde keus en mentor 
voor de jongere spelers In speelde Jasjin zijn afscheidswedstrijd uitkomend voor zijn club Dinamo Moskou 
tegen een verzameling Europese sterren Een van de beste wedstrijden speelde Jasjin in toen hij 
als keeper van de 'Rest of the World XI' tegen Engeland speelde als jubileumwedstrijd ter 
ere van het bestaan van de Engelse voetbalbond Hij had verschillende bijnamen als 'de zwarte 
panter' 'de zwarte spin' of 'de zwarte octopus' dankzij zijn altijd geheel zwarte outfit acrobatische 
reddingen en lange handen Na zijn carrière probeerde Jasjin het nog een tijdje als trainer 
in de tweede divisie van Finland en bij enkele jeugdteams In het stadion van Dinamo 
Moskou staat inmiddels een bronzen standbeeld van Jasjin die tot de grootsten van de club 
wordt gerekend In werd Jasjin gekozen in het FIFAteam van de eeuw en kreeg hij 
postuum de prijs voor 'keeper van de eeuw' Lev Jasjin overleed in als gevolg van 
complicaties veroorzaakt door de amputatie van een van zijn benen Hij staat nog altijd bekend 
als een briljant keeper De FIFA heeft de prijs voor beste doelman op een wereldkampioenschap 
naar Jasjin vernoemd Als voetballer Individueel Als ijshockeyer en * Het verhaal van Valentina Yashin

Het Gulden Vlies van Thule is het derde deel van een trilogie van Thea Beckman 
uitgegeven in Het is een toekomstroman over Thule eeuwen na de Derde Wereldoorlog Enkele decennia 
na de gebeurtenissen in Het helse paradijs zijn de Badeners er alsnog in geslaagd enkele 
delen van Thule te bezetten De steden Upernavik Gothab Frederiksborg Julianehab en Kulus zijn bezet 
en de Badeners trachten de gebieden te koloniseren De Badeners hadden de steden direct zonder 
waarschuwing gebombardeerd en aangevallen waarbij duizenden Thulen omkwamen waaronder Konega FerikaDottir en haar vader Christian 
De bevolking bood geen weerstand maar vluchtte; derhalve werden de steden herbevolkt met Badense kolonisten 
die direct in de leegstaande Thuleense huizen konden trekken De Badeners krijgen echter te maken 
met "terroristische aanslagen" op hun steden en krachtcentrales door de Thulenen Ze kunnen de wildernis 
niet penetreren en de daders blijven onvindbaar Elvira is de dochter van een ambtenaar die 
ondergouverneur van Upernavik wordt Hij wordt echter met een strafexpeditie meegestuurd het binnenland in Elvira 
denkt dat de gouverneur Kloritz dit deed omdat Elvira's vader klaagde over corruptie De expeditie 
verdwijnt spoorloos slechts een paar ondervoede soldaten bereiken Upernavik weer Uit hun verslagen blijkt dat 
de strafexpeditie een grote mislukking was en dat de Badeners door de Thulenen in de 
val gelokt waren gevangen genomen en dat hen de volgende keus was aangeboden Thuleen worden 
of ongewapend en zonder bepakking naar Badens gebied teruglopen Elvira's vader is er niet bij 
Elvira die van een Thuleense genaamd Beda waarvan later blijkt dat ze vroeger de gewestbestuurster 
was van Upernavik de taal heeft geleerd gaat het binnenland in om haar vader te 
zoeken Haar vader blijkt te zijn doodgeschoten Dit moet opzettelijk op bevel van gouverneur Kloritz 
zijn geschied; de schotwond was in het achterhoofd en Thulenen bezitten geen vuurwapens Ze legt 
in de stad Sissaa contact met de Thuleense Konegazoon Tjalf Die brengt haar naar Holtak 
de nieuwe voorlopige hoofdstad van Thule In de tussentijd leren ook de drie slimme dochters 
van oppergouverneur Von Birken de Thuleense taal Shasita Hajo en Reni trekken uiteindelijk het binnenland 
in om contacten met de Thulenen te leggen Ze hopen wellicht handelscontacten te kunnen openen 
met de Thulenen Shasita Hajo en Reni willen naar Holtak waar Elvira al is Dit 
leidt tot een voorzichtige BadensThuleense toenaderingspoging Elvira wil vrede Shasita Hajo en Reni willen een 
soort handel Ze spelen als tolk tussen de Badeners en Thulenen Thura de weduwe van 
Konegazoon Christian en grootmoeder van de huidige Konega leidt het verzet en eist volledige ontruiming 
van de steden Nu blijkt dat de Britten en Kanadenen een tegen het Badense Rijk 
gerichte alliantie met Thule hebben en dat aan de grenzen van de Badense gebieden Britse 
oorlogsschepen patrouilleren De Badense regering houdt dit angstvallig voor de eigen bevolking verborgen en is 
bang voor gezichtsverlies wanneer de steden ontruimd worden De Badense kolonisten beginnen echter steeds harder 
te morren vanwege toenemend voedselgebrek en de aanslagen waar de regering geen adequaat antwoord op 
heeft Nieuwe kolonisten komen niet meer naar Thule en de roep om naar huis terug 
te gaan klinkt steeds harder De vriendinnen komen na lange tijd terug in Gothab daar 
doen ze verslag uit De Badeners die een diplomaat sturen bieden Kulus en op langere 
termijn Upernavik te ontruimen Dit is voor Thura en de Konega niet acceptabel en ze 
dreigen met verdubbeling van de aanslagen Elvira gaat een keer terug naar Upernavik daar moet 
ze een brief geven aan Kloritz Maar ze wil er ook haar familie zien haar 
moeder vertellen dat haar vader dood is en zien hoe de toestand daar is Elvira's 
moeder is hertrouwd met de huisknecht en keurt Elvira's gedrag duidelijk af haar jongere broer 
Arnoud gedraagt zich arrogant en bazig Eenmaal bij Kloritz verklaart Kloritz haar schuldig aan landveraad 
en sluit haar op Shasita maakt zich zorgen om haar en trekt er ook op 
uit om te zien wat er met Elvira gebeurd is Het schip loopt vast en 
zinkt maar ze weet toch veilig aan wal te komen Vanaf daar gaan ze verder 
op reis naar Upernavik Als ze onderweg Tjalf en een paar woudlopers tegenkomt schieten die 
haar te hulp Tjalf bevrijdt Elvira Weer in Gothab doen ze opnieuw verslag uit samen 
met de vredesonderhandelaar vertrekken ze na een tijd naar Holtak om opnieuw te praten met 
Thura alleen nu met de vrouwenraad en de vredesonderhandelaar erbij Uiteindelijk nadat Thura de vredesonderhandelaar 
wat kostbare zaken heeft gegeven die dan aan het Badense Rijk gedoneerd zijn is hiermee 
het probleem van gezichtsverlies enigszins verholpen en wordt verder onderhandeld over de teruggave van alle 
vijf bezette steden Thura's oorspronkelijke eis Maar er mag maar een kleine groep Badeners blijven 
mits ze bereid zijn zich naar de Thuleense zeden te schikken Elvira die smoorverliefd op 
Tjalf is en vervreemd is geraakt van haar familie zal waarschijnlijk in Thule blijven later 
komt ze erachter dat Tjalf ook verliefd is op haar Ook de dochters Von Birken 
Hongshanosaurus is een geslacht van plantenetende ornithischische dinosauriërs behorend tot de groep van de Ceratopia 
dat tijdens het vroege Krijt leefde in het gebied van het huidige China De typesoort 
Hongshanosaurus houi is in benoemd en beschreven door You Hailu Xu Xing en Wang Xiaolin 
De geslachtsnaam is afgeleid van het Chinees 紅 山 hóng sjān "Rode Heuvel" een verwijzing 
naar de Hongsjancultuur De soortaanduiding eert de paleontoloog Hou Lianhai Het holotype IVPP is gevonden 
in de onderste Yixianformatie van de Jeholgroep die dateert uit het Barremien ongeveer miljoen jaar 
oud Het bestaat uit de resten van een schedel van een jong dier In is 
een nieuw specimen IVPP aan de soort toegewezen bestaande uit de gedeeltelijke schedel en onderkaken 
van een volwassen dier In de jaren daarna zijn verschillende andere vondsten gedaan die nog 
onbeschreven zijn In stelde Paul Sereno dat Hongshanosaurus niet te onderscheiden viel van verschillende soorten 
van Psittacosaurus en hernoemde de soort tot een Psittacosaurus houi als nomen dubium Een studie 
uit concludeerde echter dat de soort identiek was aan de in benoemde Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis holotype 
ZMNH waaraan ook weer de in benoemde Psittacosaurus major holotype LH identiek is Als eerder 
benoemde naam heeft Hongshanosaurus prioriteit Naar keuze kan de soort Psittacosaurus houi genoemd worden Het 
gelijkstellen van de drie soorten voegt grote hoeveelheden materiaal aan Hongshanosaurus toe waaronder de paratypen 
van Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis ZMNH een schedel met onderkaken en drie halswervels; PKUP een schedel met 
onderkakane van een jong dier; en PKUP een schedel met onderkaken proatlas en atlas van

LPM LPM LPM JZMP en LHPV Hongshanosaurus is een kleine tweevoetige planteneter met een lengte 
van zo'n anderhalve meter De schedellengte bij het holotype bedraagt nog geen vijf centimeter; bij 
het volwassen exemplaar ongeveer twintig centimeter De vrij platte en korte kop draagt een hoornsnavel 
en heeft op ieder op zich al sterk uitstekend jukbeen een kleine zijwaartse hoorn Het 
snaveldragend been op de bovenkaken het os rostrale is halfcirkelvormig in doorsnee De snuit is 
erg spits Het quadratum helt sterk naar achteren wat de platheid nog vergroot en de 
schedel in die richting verlengt Volgens Sereno is de spitsheid van de schedel het gevolg 
van samendrukking van het fossiel en was de kop in het echt bol en hoog 
De onderkaken zijn hoog en dragen ieder tien tanden Hongshanosaurus is door de beschrijvers toegewezen 
aan de Psittacosauridae maar zonder exacte analyse Het holotype is zo slecht bewaardgebleven dat wel 
gesteld is dat Hongshanosaurus een nomen dubium is Problematisch is ook de relatie met het 
verwante geslacht Psittacosaurus waarin naar moderne maatstaven zeer veel soorten zijn benoemd Het kan zijn 
dat Hongshanosaurus fylogenetisch in de soortengroep van Psittacosaurus valt De vaststelling in die zin door 
Sereno leidde er in toe dat het taxon als een soort van Psittacosaurus werd benoemd 
De oogvlekzeeengel Squatina tergocellatoides is een vis uit de familie van zeeengelen Squatinidae en behoort 
tot de orde van haaien De haai kan een lengte bereiken van centimeter De oogvlekzeeengel 
is een zoutwatervis die leeft in het noordwestelijk deel van de Grote Oceaan op het 
continentaal plat tussen Taiwan en het vasteland van China zie kaartje De diepteverspreiding is tot 
meter onder het wateroppervlak Het is net als de andere soorten zeeengelen een haai die 
voornamelijk op de zeebodem leeft De oogvlekzeeengel is voor de visserij van geen belang Deze 
vis is zeer zeldzaam en wordt zo nu en dan en steeds minder vaak aangetroffen 
op vismarkten Omdat de vis leeft in gebieden waar intensief wordt gevist en omdat bekend 
is dat de minder zeldzame soorten zeeengelen veel te lijden hebben door deze visserij is 
Elm Park was een voetbalstadion in Reading Engeland Het stadion werd gebouwd in en Reading 
FC speelde er vanaf dat moment haar thuiswedstrijden In verhuisde deze club naar het Madejski 
Stadium De eerste wedstrijd op Elm Park werd gespeeld op september Reading speelde voor ongeveer 
toeschouwers tegen Arthur Roston Bourke's XI een team van Hollowaystudenten Het stond voor de thuisploeg 
toen de wedstrijd werd gestaakt vanwege slecht weer Reading kreeg na afloop ook nog eens 
een boete voor het feit dat ze tegen een team speelden dat niet geregistreerd was 
bij de Engelse voetbalbond In werd op een clubvergadering gesteld dat er een nieuwe thuisbasis 
moest komen in de buurt van het treinstation Deze verhuizing werd echter afgeblazen in verband 
met de activiteiten van de Great Western Railway Toen Reading in het seizoen degradeerde naar 
de vierde divisie leek de club te moeten fuseren met Oxford United en daarmee zou 
Elm Park haar deuren moeten sluiten De fusie kon worden afgewend en onder leiding van 
Ian Branfoot promoveerde de club het seizoen daarna alweer naar de derde divisie en was 
het stadion daarmee gered Vanaf mochten in de hoogste twee divisies de eerste divisie van 
de Football League en de Premier League uit veiligheidsoverwegingen alleen nog zitplaatsen in de stadions 
zijn Juist in dat jaar werd Reading kampioen van de tweede divisie en promoveerde het 
naar de eerste divisie De club stelde vast dat het niet praktisch was om alle 
staanplaatsen te veranderen in zitplaatsen en dus werden plannen gemaakt voor een nieuw stadion Vier 
jaar later werd de bouw van het Madejski Stadium voltooid en speelde de club haar 
laatste wedstrijd op Elm Park Op mei gebeurde dit tegen Norwich City en een jonge 
Craig Bellamy zorgde in dienst van Norwich met het enige doelpunt van de wedstrijd voor 
een teleurstellend afscheid van Elm Park Dit stadion werd later in afgebroken op de plek 
De politiekterritoriale ontwikkeling van de tot de eeuw van het graafschap Vlaanderen is vooral een 
zaak geweest van de opeenvolgende Vlaamse graven Zij hebben zowel de interne consolidatie als de 
externe expansie van het graafschap tot stand gebracht Het Vlaanderen van de eeuw heeft zijn 
naam ontleend aan dit historische graafschap Het woord Vlaming is afgeleid van het Germaanse woord 
flauma wat vloed betekent Wie in een gebied woonde dat onderhevig was aan overstromingen was 
een flaumung De Romeinen noemden ze Flandrensis en de gouw Flandria De stap naar Vlaming 
en Vlaanderen is dan nog Boudewijn I wordt als de eerste graaf van Vlaanderen beschouwd 
Hij kwam vermoedelijk uit de streek van Laon en was de zoon van een zekere 
Audacer Boudewijn heeft niets te maken met de fabuleuze “forestiers van Vlaanderen” ontsproten aan de 
fantasie van overijverige middeleeuwse schrijvers Boudewijn kreeg de bijnaam “met de IJzeren Arm” door de 
schaking in van Judith de dochter van koning Karel de Kale van WestFrancië Judith achterkleindochter 
van Karel de Grote was door haar vader opgesloten in een toren te Soissons in 
afwachting van een gouden kans op de huwelijksmarkt Met de hulp van kroonprins Lodewijk kon 
ze ontsnappen in de armen van Boudewijn De koning was helemaal niet zinnens zijn dochter 
uit te huwelijken aan de eerste de beste avonturier nadat ze al tweemaal een Engelse 
koning tot echtgenoot had gehad Hij liet zijn bisschoppen de ban uitspreken over het koppel 
Boudewijn en Judith vluchtten over de Alpen en zochten hun toevlucht bij paus Nicolaas I 
Die koos dan de zijde van de geliefden en trachtte de koning te overhalen Boudewijn 
dreigde er zelfs mee zich met de Noormannen te verbinden Uiteindelijk ging Karel de Kale 
overstag Eind werd het huwelijk tussen Boudewijn en Judith gesloten Als gevolg van zijn huwelijk 
met een Karolingische prinses werd Boudewijn beleend met enkele publieke functies Hij kreeg in de 
gouwen Flandrensis rond Brugge Waas Kortrijk en bezat wellicht ook de gouw Gent zodat dit 
een aangesloten geheel vormde Na verkreeg hij ook de Ternaasgouw Ternois met daarin geleden de 
stad Terwaan Hij werd in begraven in de SintBertijnsabdij te SintOmaars die ook in deze 
gouw lag Deze abdij zou later voor nog een aantal graven van Vlaanderen de laatste 
rustplaats worden Tijdens de Franse Revolutie werden die graftomben vernield Men beschouwt Boudewijn I als 
de laatste koninklijke ambtenaar binnen zijn familie Zijn erfgenamen zouden een veel zelfstandiger koers kunnen 
varen omdat het koninklijke gezag in Parijs danig verzwakte onder meer door de invallen van 
de Noormannen De dood van Boudewijn I in viel wellicht niet toevallig samen met nieuwe 
invallen van de Noormannen in deze streek Pas in de zomer van vielen ze de 
noordelijke pagus Flandrensis binnen om dan voor de winter het land te verlaten Boudewijn II 
zoon van Boudewijn I is blijkbaar als gevolg van de Noormanneninval naar de noordelijker gelegen 
pagus Flandrensis gevlucht Dit werd zijn nieuwe machtsbasis Wellicht hield Boudewijn II zich met zijn 
familie schuil in de vesting van Brugge Hij zou de echte stichter van het graafschap 
Vlaanderen worden Het hele gebied was verlaten; ook de ambtenaren en soldaten van de koning 
waren vertrokken Voor koning Karloman van Frankrijk was het onmogelijk om het vlakke en door 
vele rivieren doorkruiste Vlaanderen te verdedigen tegen de Noormannen Hij schoof de grens van zijn 
rijk achteruit tot aan de Artesische heuvels richtte er een mark op en gaf die 
in leen aan zijn verwant abt Rudolf die zo de Ternaasgouw Ternois en de abdijen 
SintBertijns en SintVaast in zijn bezit kreeg Na het vertrek van de Noormannen kon Boudewijn 
II het noordelijke gebied zonder slag of stoot tot het zijne verklaren en zo werd 
hij heerser van een vorstendom dat van de Noordzee tot aan de heuvels van Artesië 
reikte Zo ontstond in of kort daarop het zelfstandige graafschap Vlaanderen Boudewijns optreden werd niet 
alleen vergemakkelijkt door het machtsvacuüm in het gebied als gevolg van de Noormanneninvallen maar ook 
door de ineenstorting van de macht van de Franse koning Boudewijn maakte zich niet alleen 
meester van enkele gouwen die eertijds aan zijn vader toebehoorden namelijk Waas Gent en Kortrijk 
hij breidde dit ook uit met de noordelijker gelegen gouwen Vlaanderen Rodenburg en Mempiscus en 
de vijf pagi tussen Leie en Schelde In stierf abtgraaf Rudolf Hierdoor kon Boudewijn II 
de hand leggen op de Ternaasgouw met de abdij van SintBertijns en op de stad 
Atrecht met de abdij van SintVaast Nog in hetzelfde jaar maakte hij zich ook meester 
van de gouwen Vermandois Bonen Boulogne en Artesië Artois De koning Odo I van Frankrijk 
kon dit niet laten gebeuren en er kwam oorlog van In kwamen de beide mannen 
tot een akkoord Boudewijn II deed afstand van Vermandois maar behield Bonen en Artesië Boudewijn 
II deed in echter opnieuw een poging om SintKwintens SaintQuentin de hoofdstad van Vermandois te 
veroveren Maar de koning rukte met zijn leger binnen en sloeg het beleg voor Atrecht 
dat spoedig in zijn handen viel Hierdoor verloor Boudewijn II de hele gouw Artesië met 
de rijke SintVaastabdij Boudewijn zag na deze rampzalige oorlog tegen koning Karel III in dat 
verder strijden niet veel zin meer had en hij is zich meer gaan toeleggen op 
de interne bevestiging van zijn macht in zijn graafschap Hij beschikte bovendien over een reusachtig 
domein dat hij verworven had door zich na de aftocht van de Noormannen de grondeigendommen 
van de Kerk de koning en misschien ook van grootgrondbezitters toe te eigenen Bovendien had 
hij als vorst het recht op de woeste en braakliggende gronden Om zijn land beter 
te kunnen verdedigen tegen volgende invallen van Noormannen heeft hij reeds vanaf een aantal vestingen 
laten optrekken langs de kustlijn namelijk te Oostburg Aardenburg Brugge Oudenburg Gistel Veurne Broekburg en 
SintWinoksbergen maar ook binnenlands onder andere in Gent en Kortrijk Boudewijn II stierf in Na 
het overlijden van Boudewijn II werd zijn vorstendom verdeeld onder zijn twee zonen Arnulf kreeg 
de gebieden waarover zijn vader vrijwel onmiddellijk regeerde namelijk de streek tussen de Noordzee de 
Schelde en de Artesische heuvels Vanaf dan werd de naam Vlaanderen voor dit hele gebied 
gebruikt Tot het erfdeel van de jongere zoon Adalolf behoorden de later veroverde gebieden dit 
zijn de gouwen Bonen en Ternaas Wellicht behield Arnulf als oudste zoon een soort soevereiniteit 
over de gebieden van zijn broer Ondanks al zijn inspanningen heeft Boudewijn II geen gaaf 
vorstendom kunnen nalaten Vlaanderen zou pas zijn natuurlijke grenzen bereiken met het bezit van de 
gouwen Artesië Artois Ponthieu en Oosterbant Ostrevent Artesië zou dan een sterke bareel zijn tegen 
de invallen uit het zuiden terwijl de hoofdplaats van Ponthieu Montreuil de enige oversteekplaats was 
over de rivier de Kwinte Canche de zuidgrens van Vlaanderen Ten slotte zou met het 
bezit van Oosterbant de Schelde overal bereikt worden In de verwarring ontstaan door de strijd 
om de oppermacht in Frankrijk kon Arnulf I in de hand leggen op Mortagne de 
tweede vesting van Oosterbant Het jaar daarop in stierf de gouwgraaf van Artesië Adelelm en 
daarvan maakte Arnulf gebruik om diens hele gouw met de SintVaastabdij in te palmen Iets 
later viel ook de hoofdstad van Oosterbant Dowaai samen met de rest van de gouw 
in handen van Arnulf In overleed zijn broer Adalolf en daarop maakte Arnulf zich meester 
van diens bezit namelijk de gouwen Bonen en Ternaas Hierdoor ontzegde hij wel de zonen 
van Adalolf hun erfdeel In kon de Karolinger Lodewijk IV van Overzee bezit nemen van 
de troon in Frankrijk Hij moest hiervoor vanuit Engeland via Bonen naar zijn nieuw koninkrijk 
reizen Deze eerste ontmoeting schijnt de aanzet te zijn geweest voor een lange vriendschap tussen 
graaf Arnulf en Lodewijk Het is in die tijd dat Arnulf de titel van markgraaf 
aanneemt; waarschijnlijk werd hij door de koning met deze waardigheid vereerd Enige tijd later braken 
er conflicten uit met graafschap Normandië en graaf en vikingkoning Willem I van Normandië De 
stad Montreuil werd heen en weer veroverd maar zonder definitief resultaat voor de Vlamingen De 
stad was zo belangrijk omdat het de enige oversteekplaats was voor een leger over de 
Kwinte; uitgestrekte moerassen maakten dit verderop onmogelijk Montreuil was dus de sleutel van de zuidgrens 
van Vlaanderen en van de noordgrens van Normandië Pas in verkreeg Arnulf deze stad door 
een schenking van de machtigste edelman van Frankrijk hertog Hugo die hoopte hiermee de steun 
van de graaf voor zich te winnen Dit lukte evenwel niet integendeel toen er een 
opstand losbrak tegen Hugo kon Arnulf Amiens op hem veroveren In de jaren stond Arnulf 
I op het hoogtepunt van zijn regering Hij had Vlaanderen tot aan de Somme uitgebreid 
en er heerste rust in het land De enkele moeilijkheden die zich voordeden liet hij 
aan zijn zoon Boudewijn over die hij graaf schijnt gemaakt te hebben van de zuidelijke 
gouwen van Vlaanderen Deze laatste wordt meestal aangeduid onder de benaming Boudewijn III maar hij 
is nooit graaf van Vlaanderen geweest hoogstens medegraaf onder Arnulf I Boudewijn III sterft namelijk 
in en laat enkel een minderjarige zoon Arnulf achter De zonen van Adalolf de overleden 
broer van Arnulf I grepen hun kans om het erfdeel van hun vader op te 
eisen en kwamen in opstand Graaf Arnulf I begreep dadelijk dat zijn verwanten zijn kleinzoon 
zouden behandelen zoals hij met zijn neven had gedaan Hij zag zijn levenswerk verloren gaan 
wanhopig liet hij een van hen om het leven brengen in de hoop de ander 
schrik aan te jagen Maar integendeel deze ging nu nog feller te keer Daarom zocht 
hij zijn toevlucht tot een laatste redmiddel om althans een deel van zijn vorstendom voor 
zijn kleinzoon te bewaren Hij ging naar zijn opperleenheer de Franse koning Lotharius van Frankrijk 
en ze kwamen tot een akkoord Wanneer Arnulf stierf zou Lotharius al diens veroverde gebieden 
krijgen namelijk Amiens Ponthieu Artesië en Oosterbant In ruil daarvoor zou Lotharius voogd worden van 
de jonge Arnulf tijdens diens minderjarigheid en ervoor zorgen dat Arnulf erkend zou worden als 
graaf in de rest van Vlaanderen Tevens moest ook Boudewijn Baldzo wellicht een zoon van 
Arnulf I’s oom Rudolf waken over de kleine Arnulf De overgebleven zoon van Adalolf ook 
een Arnulf zou het erfdeel krijgen van zijn vader namelijk de gouwen Bonen en Ternaas 
De oude graaf Arnulf I overleed in Zoals Arnulf I voorzien had volgde na zijn 
dood een totale ineenstorting van het grafelijk gezag Lotharius hield zich nog aan het akkoord 
deed Arnulf II als graaf erkennen en eigende zich de zuidelijke gebieden van Vlaanderen toe 
Edellieden beschouwden echter hun lenen als hun eigendom en usurpeerden de grafelijke rechten Arnulf II’s 
zogezegde beschermer Boudewijn Baldzo maakte zich meester van een eigen graafschap Kortrijk Dirk II van 
Holland graaf van WestFriesland en aangetrouwde oom van Arnulf II werd graaf van Gent en 
Waas Arnulf de zoon van Adalolf nam wat hem van rechtswege toekwam en werd graaf 
van Bonen en Ternaas Arnulf II stelde zich tevreden met wat er van zijn graafschap 
overbleef de streek tussen de Leie en de zee en met zijn theoretisch leenheerlijk gezag 
over de graafschappen die Dirk van WestFriesland en Arnulf van Bonen hadden verkregen Vroeger al 
had een groep Vikingen zich onder leiding van Siegfried van Denemarken hoewel deze figuur ook 
legendarisch kan zijn gevestigd in het Boonse aan de Noordzeekust Wellicht trouwde hij met een 
dochter van Arnulf I en hun zoon Adolf verkreeg van Arnulf II de titel van 
graaf van Gizene Guînes Na de dood van Arnulf van Bonen werd diens graafschap verdeeld 
onder zijn twee zonen de ene kreeg Bonen de andere Ternaas Verderop in Vlaanderen werd 
Boudewijn Baldzo in het grootste gedeelte van het graafschap Kortrijk opgevolgd door Eilbodo terwijl het 
noordelijke gebied wellicht gevoegd werd bij het vorstendom van de graaf van WestFriesland Arnulf II 
was een zwak vorst en toen hij stierf in zag de toekomst er niet rooskleurig 
uit voor zijn geslacht Niet alleen was Vlaanderen sterk ineengekrompen bovendien kwam opnieuw een minderjarige 
graaf op de troon ditmaal Boudewijn IV Het geslacht der Baldwinen zou zich echter herpakken 
Ze kregen hierbij zelfs een steuntje in de rug van de overmoedige Capetingers Hugo Capet 
had zich wel meester kunnen maken van de Franse kroon rijk was hij echter niet 
Wat hij nodig had was een groot vorstendom dat de luister van zijn dynastie zou 
verhogen Hij liet zijn oog vallen op Vlaanderen en regelde een huwelijk tussen zijn jonge 
zoon Robrecht met Suzanna de weduwe van Arnulf II Zolang Boudewijn IV minderjarig bleef zou 
Robrecht er het grafelijk gezag uitoefenen en het graafschap misschien wel kunnen behouden Hugo was 
tot zware offers bereid en liet Artesië Oosterbant en Ponthieu voor Suzanna vastleggen Maar het 
draaide anders uit Reeds na enkele jaren werd de rijpe bijna oude Suzanna verstoten door 
de jonge en lichtzinnige Robrecht De Franse koning weigerde echter de beloofde gebieden aan Suzanna 
te geven De Vlamingen lieten het hier niet bij en er kwam oorlog van Uiteindelijk 
werd deze beslecht met een akkoord waarbij Artesië en Oosterbant definitief aan Vlaanderen werden gegeven 
terwijl Ponthieu met Montreuil aan de kroon bleef Boudewijn IV was inmiddels volwassen en vastbesloten 
het weggekwijnde grafelijk gezag in Vlaanderen te herstellen Hij beroofde Eilbodo van Kortrijk van diens 
onwettige gezag en toen Arnulf graaf van WestFriesland in sneuvelde en alleen een jonge zoon 
naliet kon Boudewijn de graafschappen Gent en Waas terug onder zijn rechtstreeks gezag plaatsen Dat 
gebeurde niet met de zuidelijke graafschappen waarvoor hij zich tevreden stelde met de erkenning van 
zijn leenheerschappij Het Graafschap Ternaas was verder uiteengevallen het noordelijke deel met de steden Ariën 
Aire en SintOmaars keerde terug naar het graafschap Vlaanderen het zuidelijke deel bleef zelfstandig onder 
de naam Graafschap SaintPol Graafschap SintPols maar verloor later nog het zuiden van zijn grondgebied 
dat het graafschap Hesdin Graafschap Heusden werd De Vlaamse graaf was dus leenman van de 
Franse koning voor het markgraafschap Vlaanderen en op zijn beurt leenheer van de graven van 
Bonen Gizene SintPols en later nog Hesdin Ook intern wilde Boudewijn IV zijn gezag versterken 
Om een steviger greep krijgen op zijn eigen binnenland begon hij in met de reorganisatie 
van de Vlaamse gewesten Het graafschap Vlaanderen werd namelijk ingedeeld in vrij grote gewestelijke eenheden 
kasselrijen of burggraafschappen genaamd Elk burggraafschap was als het ware gericht op een centrale grafelijke 
burcht De oudste waren Brugge Gent Doornik en SintOmaars De onderliggende gouwen bleven zichtbaar sommigen 
werden echter afgeschaft zoals de Mepsegouw terwijl andere hun eigenheid hebben weten te bewaren zoals 
het Land van Waas en het Land van Pévèle met Pevelenberg Grootste vernieuwing was dat 
de bruggraaf wel zijn ambt in leen hield maar niet meer de grafelijke burcht en 
het territorium De edelen die hij opriep en leidde bleven krijgers van de graaf Hij 
was echter geen beroepsambtenaar die zoals de baljuw later zomaar door de graaf verplaatst of 
afgezet kon worden Met de instelling van burggraafschappen legde Boudewijn IV een steviger fundering onder 
het grafelijk gezag Toen dit gerealiseerd was kon hij zich gaan concentreren op territoriale expansie 
In het zuiden had het Normandische blok zich nog uitgebreid en werd het slechts door 
Ponthieu van Vlaanderen gescheiden Verdere expansie van Vlaanderen naar het zuiden was dus niet meer 
mogelijk Boudewijn IV richtte zijn blik naar het oosten naar het hertogdom NederLotharingen waar de 
keizerlijke macht aan het verzwakken was Daar probeerden de voornaamste graven hun gebied uit te 
breiden ten koste van de bisschoppen en de keizer Er was echter één hinderpaal voor 
Vlaanderen Om een inval vanuit het westen te verhinderen hadden de keizers een aantal marken 
opgericht op de rechteroever van de Schelde Dit waren van zuid naar noord de mark 
Valencijn de mark Ename en de mark Antwerpen Indien Boudewijn IV wilde slagen in zijn 
uitbreidingspolitiek zou hij eerst deze keizerlijke burchtenlinie moeten breken Om echter een inval vanuit Lotharingen 
in Vlaanderen te verhinderen organiseerde of voltooide hij ook een gordel van burchten langs de 
Schelde namelijk in Gent Oudenaarde en Doornik Boudewijn IV begon met de meest zuidelijke vesting 
Valencijn Rond was hij al in een oorlog verwikkeld met Arnulf de keizerlijke markgraaf in 
de streek van Valencijn In kon Boudewijn zich meester maken van Valencijn Een belegering door 
een brede coalitie tussen de Duitse keizer Keizer Hendrik II de Heilige de koning van 
Frankrijk Robert II en de hertog van Normandië Richard II van Normandië kon hem niet 
op de knieën krijgen maar een verwoestende inval in Vlaanderen door Duitse troepen kon dat 
wel Boudewijn moest Valencijn terug afstaan In maakte hij echter gebruik van de dood van 
graaf Arnulf van Valencijn om de stad opnieuw te bezetten Keizer Hendrik II kon de 
steun van de Vlaamse graaf wel gebruiken tegen een opstand van Lotharingse edelen en hoopte 
deze dan ook te verkrijgen door Boudewijn niet alleen te erkennen als graaf van Valencijn 
maar hem ook nog Walcheren met de bijbehorende Zeeuwse eilanden en de latere Vier Ambachten 
te schenken Boudewijn IV had vaste voet gekregen aan de rechteroever van de Schelde en 
bovendien was hij nu zowel vazal van de Franse koning voor KroonVlaanderen als van de 
Duitse keizer voor RijksVlaanderen Rond is hij weer in oorlog met de Franse koning Robert 
II Om zijn Lotharingse politiek te kunnen verderzetten besefte Boudewijn dat hij vrede moest zien 
te sluiten met de koning van Frankrijk Ze kwamen tot het akkoord dat Boudewijns zoon 
de latere Boudewijn V zou huwen met Adela de jongste dochter van de koning Zij 
werd voortaan aan het Vlaamse hof opgevoed Deze verbintenis tussen het koninklijk huis en de 
grafelijke dynastie van Vlaanderen zou honderd jaar bijna ononderbroken vrede tussen Vlaanderen en Frankrijk tot 
gevolg hebben Maar de latere Boudewijn V voelde zich nu zo verheven dat hij niet 
langer wilde wachten op zijn vaders dood om hem te kunnen opvolgen Met een deel 
van de adel achter zich kwam hij in opstand Boudewijn IV moest zelfs zijn toevlucht 
zoeken bij de hertog van Normandië Robert de Duivel Hij wist met de hulp van 
de Normandiër zijn zoon op de knieën te krijgen en uiteindelijk verzoenden vader en zoon 
zich terug met elkaar Boudewijn IV kon zich nu richten op Ename In namen de 
Vlamingen de burcht van Ename in en staken die in brand De graaf die in 
stierf haalde dus niet alleen het grafelijk gezag uit de crisis maar slaagde er ook 
nog in het graafschap Vlaanderen uit te breiden Hij putte zich niet uit in wanhopige 
pogingen om Ponthieu te herwinnen maar stelde zich tevreden met Artesië waarmee Vlaanderen zijn historische 
en aardrijkskundige grenzen bereikte Uitbreiding zag Boudewijn wel mogelijk in oostelijke richting en met Walcheren 
en de andere eilanden van Zeeland Bewestenschelde de Vier Ambachten Ename en Valencijn had hij 
de ijzeren ring die Vlaanderens expansie moest beletten doen springen Boudewijn V maakte het werk 
van zijn vader in het land tussen Schelde en Dender af De Vlamingen konden zich 
in vanuit Ename ook meester maken van de hele mark Ename Bovendien verkreeg Boudewijn van 
de Duitse keizer Keizer Hendrik III voor zijn zoon ook nog het markgraafschap Antwerpen Hiermee 
leek Vlaanderen wel volledig uit zijn voegen te zijn gebarsten maar het was een vergiftigd 
geschenk De keizer hoopte met zijn daad Boudewijns steun te verwerven in zijn oorlog tegen 
zijn opstandige vazal Godfried hertog van OpperLotharingen en diens bondgenoot de Franse koning Hendrik I 
van Frankrijk Toch schaarde Boudewijn zich uit louter politiek belang bij de vijanden van de 
keizer Maar de Franse koning en de Duitse keizer verzoenden zich met elkaar De Engelse 
en Deense koningen Eduard de Belijder en Sven II van Denemarken organiseerden een blokkade van 
de Vlaamse kust en een keizerlijke militaire overmacht dwong Boudewijn tot onderwerping Boudewijn verloor het 
markgraafschap Antwerpen en bovendien behield hij alleen het noordelijke deel van de mark Ename terwijl 
Valencijn en het zuiden van de mark Ename onder graafschap Henegouwen kwamen Maar Boudewijn V 
gaf niet op In mei overleed graaf Herman van Henegouwen en diens weduwe Richilde nam 
het beheer over Boudewijn kon een huwelijk forceren tussen haar en zijn zoon de latere 
Boudewijn VI zonder dat de vereiste keizerlijke instemming was gevraagd Een strafexpeditie tegen Vlaanderen haalde 
niets uit en uiteindelijk kregen Richilde en de jonge Boudewijn Boudewijn I voor de Henegouwers 
in de keizerlijke investituur van Henegouwen De rechten van de kinderen van Herman van Henegouwen 
werden hiermee aan de kant geschoven Boudewijn V kon bovendien ook voor zijn andere kinderen 
succesvolle huwelijken sluiten Robrecht huwde in met Geertrui weduwe van de graaf van Holland Floris 
I van Holland waardoor hij in dat graafschap het bewind kon voeren in naam van 
zijn nog onmondige stiefkinderen Mathilde trouwde waarschijnlijk in met Willem de Veroveraar hertog van Normandië 
die in bezit kon nemen van Engeland Mathilde werd in mei te Westminster gekroond en 
gezalfd tot koningin van Engeland De Vlaamse graaf zette ook de gewestelijke reorganisatiepolitiek van zijn 
vader verder ten gunste van de interne consolidering van de grafelijke macht Het aantal burggraafschappen 
werd nog uitgebreid door een aantal ondergeschikte ressorten of ambachten los te maken uit een 
ouder burggraafschap Boudewijn V kondigde in samen met de bisschop van Terwaan Drogo van Terwaan 
een godsbestand af in zijn land dit betekende dat op er niet mocht gevochten worden 
op bepaalde dagen Zo zorgde de graaf voor de pacificatie van zijn land en verwierf 
hij zo bovendien het alleenrecht op oorlogvoering Boudewijn V stierf in en werd opgevolgd door 
zijn oudste zoon Boudewijn VI Om de vrede te bewaren na zijn overlijden had Boudewijn 
V voor zijn jongere zoon Robrecht de Fries een zeer ambitieus figuur een vorstendom buiten 
Vlaanderen gezocht Hij werd zoals reeds vermeld uitgehuwd aan de weduwe van de graafschap Holland 
Bovendien moest Robrecht dadelijk na zijn huwelijk afstand doen van al zijn rechten op de 
opvolging in Vlaanderen Met Boudewijn VI kwam een personele unie tot stand tussen het graafschap 
Vlaanderen en het graafschap Henegouwen wellicht hoopte hij op termijn ook een structurele eenheid te 
kunnen verwezenlijken zodat hij over een nog machtiger bolwerk zou regeren tussen Frankrijk en het 
Duitse rijk Maar die plannen werden echter doorkruist door zijn vroegtijdig overlijden in Hij had 
slechts drie jaar geregeerd over Vlaanderen; zijn nog heel jonge zoon Arnulf III zou het 
er nog slechter vanaf brengen Nu rook Robrecht de Fries zijn kans Hij had een 
aanzienlijke machtspositie opgebouwd in het noorden en wilde maar al te graag het belangrijke graafschap 
Vlaanderen verwerven Hij moedigde een opstand aan tegen Arnulf III en diens moeder Richilde Robrecht 
slaagde erin een aantal steden en een belangrijk deel van de Vlaamse ridderschap vooral uit 
het noordelijke Dietstalige gebied van het graafschap voor zich te winnen en hij viel Vlaanderen 
binnen Vlaanderen kende zijn eerste grote burgeroorlog Arnulf III kreeg de steun van een grote 
coalitie tegen Robrecht bestaande uit zijn leenheer de Franse koning Filips I van Frankrijk zijn 
oom Willem de Veroveraar echter slechts tien Normandische ridders de graaf van Leuven Hendrik II 
van Leuven en de overwegend Romaanstalige heren uit het zuiden Arnulf werd echter verslagen in 
de slag bij Kassel op februari en verloor er het leven Robrecht werd in Vlaanderen 
als graaf erkend terwijl Richilde en haar tweede zoon Boudewijn genoegen moesten nemen met het 
graafschap Henegouwen Nauwelijks een maand na de nederlaag trok Richilde met een gezamenlijk Henegouws en 
Frans leger opnieuw ten strijde tegen Robrecht de Fries SintOmaars werd geplunderd en platgebrand Robrecht 
onderhandelde via de door hem gevangengenomen Eustaas I van Boulogne met zijn broer Godfried bisschop 
van Parijs en kanselier van Filips I Godfried onderhandelde een vredesakkoord Filips I gaf geen 
verdere steun geen gaf aan Richilde Robrecht huwelijkt zijn stiefdochter Bertha van Holland uit aan 
Valentin Silvestrov componeerde zijn Symfonie nr voor dwarsfluit percussie piano en strijkorkest in Aan de 
nietalledaagse instrumentatie kan je zien dat het geen normale klassieke symfonie betreft Symfonie staat hier 
voor samenspel De symfonie is geschreven vlak nadat de Italiaanse avantgarde componist Luigi Nono een 
bezoek heeft gebracht aan de SovjetUnie Hij maakte daarbij een grote indruk bij de jonge 
sovjetcomponisten Dat een dergelijk bezoek vaak alleen symbolisch was bleek wel Dit werk heeft zonder 
meer geen goedkeuring gekregen van de Sovjet Componisten Bond of andere autoriteiten De symfonie bestaat 
uit slechts één deel van ongeveer minuten Alhoewel nog wat onbeholpen vind je in het 
werk al zijn latere stijl terug Tussen de wilde en moderne klanken door hoor je 
al de meditatieve muziek waarin hij zich later specialiseerde Ook zijn er momenten van bijna 
gehele stilte De première van dit werk vond plaats op april in Leningrad door het 
Leningrad Kamer Orkest onder leiding van Igor Blasjkof De theaters in Leningrad probeerden in die

in tijdelijk met de samenwerking In kwam het duo weer samen om voor de AVRO 
het programma "Johnny en Rijk Een paar apart" te maken Het programma met komische sketches 
was grotendeels vertaald gebaseerd op de teksten van het Engelse komische duo Morecambe en Wise 
met Kraaijkamp in de rol van de bijdehante Eric Morecambe en De Gooyer als de

One Pocket is een spelvariant in het poolbiljarten Het wordt gespeeld met alle vijftien gekleurde 
ballen en kan als één tegen één of team tegen team worden uitgevoerd Voor aanvang 
van de wedstrijd wordt bepaald wie er mag beginnen Beide opponenten spelen tegelijk één bal 
over de lange zijde van de tafel en proberen deze zo te raken dat hij 
zo dicht mogelijk terugkomt bij de korte band vanwaar werd afgestoten laggen De winnaar hiervan 
kiest één van hoekpockets uit bij het rack die de rest van het spel de 
enige pocket vormt waarin hij een punt kan maken De opponent krijgt automatisch de pocket 
aan de andere kant van het rack toegewezen als richtpunt Vooraf wordt een aantal punten 
afgesproken die gemaakt moeten worden om een partij te winnen In praktijk is dit aantal 
doorgaans acht Punten kunnen enkel gemaakt worden door een bal in die ene daartoe gekozen 
pocket te potten met de witte bal als stootbal Beide spelers mogen daarvoor alle vijftien 
gekleurde ballen kiezen om mee te scoren Ballen die in andere pockets belanden komen opnieuw 
op tafel Foutief gepotte ballen leveren bovendien één strafpunt op De regels in One Pocket 
kunnen op verschillende manieren aangepast worden om twee spelers met verschillende vaardigheidsniveaus tegen elkaar te 
laten spelen Zo kan een afwijkend aantal punten om te winnen worden afgesproken bijvoorbeeld vijf 
voor de zwakkere speler en tien voor de sterkere Een andere mogelijkheid is om de 
sterkste speler alleen toe te staan punten te maken door via een band te spelen

Rallycross in Nederland ook wel Rallyracing genoemd is een autosport Rallycross wordt op permanente circuits 
van circa kilometer lang gereden minimum maximum meter Die circuits zijn deels verhard deels onverhard 
In principe geldt dat minstens verhard moet zijn en minstens onverhard maar uitzonderlijk worden ook 
autocrosscircuits gebruikt volledig onverhard op voorwaarde dat de startgrid wel van asfalt of beton is 
bijvoorbeeld de baan "Am Matschenberg" die af en toe gebruikt wordt voor het Duits kampioenschap 
en het Circuit André Toton dat enkele keren op de Franse rallycrosskalender stond Typisch voor 
veel circuits is ook de aparte startstrook dat wil zeggen dat de startplaats in het 
verlengde ligt van een rechte lijn of grote bocht zodat de volgende starters zich al 
kunnen opstellen terwijl de vorige nog aan het racen zijn Meestal bevindt de finish zich 
ook op die rechte lijn of in de bocht net voor de piloten er terug 
op komen Vanaf de finish mogen de piloten niet rechtdoor terug het rennerskwartier in kunnen 
rijden zodat ze dat zeker niet met volle snelheid doen De eerste meter vanaf de 
start moeten zeker verhard zijn en tot de eerste bocht moet de afstand minstens meter 
bedragen Het circuit moet overal tot meter breed zijn en van de start minimumbreedte per 
starter + minstens een halve meter aan elke kant tot de baanrand tot de eerste 
bocht mag er zeker geen versmalling zijn De voor internationale wedstrijden herkende circuits bezitten een 
zogenaamde Joker Lap sektie lap = ronde een iets tragere variant bijvoorbeeld een stuk onverhard 
buitenom een geheel of deels verharde bocht die de piloten in elke reeks en finale 
één keer moeten nemen maar ze mogen zelf kiezen in welke ronde Deze ronde wordt 
dan hun Joker Lap genoemd Tijdens de vrije training mag de Joker Lap gereden worden 
tijdens de tijdtraining wordt aan de Joker Lap sektie voorbijgereden Een Joker Lap moet minstens 
twee seconden langer duren dan een normale ronde Om de veiligheid te garanderen moet de 
snelheid van de piloten die het 'normale' circuit voor hun Joker Lap verlaten ongeveer even 
hoog kunnen zijn als die van de piloten die zich op die plek op het 
'normale' circuit bevinden De breedte is maximaal Veel circuits bezitten ook een chicane een iets 
smallere en soms vrij scherpe bocht Vaak kan deze zeker als ze op de eerste 
rechte lijn ligt zie boven minimumafstand en breedte tot eerste bocht in de eerste ronde 
gewoon rechtdoor voorbijgereden worden bijvoorbeeld op het Eurocircuit in Valkenswaard De hier vermelde cijfers komen 
uit de reglementen van de FIA de Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile en zijn dus niet 
per definitie op alle circuits van toepassing waar geen door de FIA georganiseerde kampioenschappen doorgaan 
Zo bedroeg de minimumbreedte volgens de AFORreglementen Frankrijk tot voor enkele jaren slechts meter nu 
breedte en is het minimum onverhard volgens de KNAFreglementen Nederland en de minimumafstand tot de 
eerste onverharde strook Eerst krijgen de piloten de kans om enkele rondjes te rijden om 
met het circuit en zijn toestand vertrouwd te raken meestal rondjes; bij wedstrijden over twee 
dagen bijvoorbeeld voor het EK begint de tweede dag ook met een "warm up" van 
rondjes vrije training Na deze vrije training is er de tijdtraining de piloten rijden individueel 
rondjes Van de tweede en de derde wordt de tijd gemeten en aan de hand 
van het beste resultaat wordt de startvolgorde voor de eerste reeks bepaald Daarbij starten de 
wagens per of van onderaan geteld per tot er of minder overblijven dan die per 
of de even bij elkaar en de oneven bij elkaar tegelijk en naast elkaar met 
als "pole" de positie aan de binnenkant van de eerste bocht Naargelang het kampioenschap en 
het circuit worden er of rondjes afgelegd De tijd hiervan geldt voor de startvolgorde voor 
de tweede reeks die op dezelfde manier verloopt Dan volgt er nog een derde reeks 
Voor de startvolgorde daarvan gelden eerste en tweede reeks samen Na de reeksen volgen de 
finales De twee beste resultaten van de reeksen worden gebruikt om de startvolgorde te bepalen; 
twee keer de finish bereiken tijdens de reeksen is dus nodig om een finale te 
mogen rijden Er zijn finales D C B en A Een DFinale wordt enkel georganiseerd 
indien er minstens piloten gekwalificeerd zijn voor de Finales De met de hoogste scores gaan 
naar de DFinale De eerste en tweede gaan samen met de volgende gekwalificeerde piloten naar 
de CFinale De winnaar daarvan krijgt de laatste startplaats bij de vijf volgende in de 
B analoog voor de A De piloten starten niet meer naast elkaar maar verspringend de 
eerste start op de pole de tweede op positie de derde achter positie de vierde 
achter positie de vijfde twee plaatsen achter de tweede en de laatste twee plaatsen achter 
positie van de reeksen het kan ook gebeuren dat de startrij van de reeksen als 
laatste startrij van de finales dienstdoet en dat plaatsen tot en met van de finales 
zich dus verder naar voor bevinden Uitzonderlijk wordt er voor nationale kampioenschappen onder andere in 
Nederland en Ierland ook per acht gestart in de finales met piloten naast elkaar op 
de eerste en de derde rij De afstand tussen de startstrepen van de verschillende rijen 
bedraagt meter Naargelang het kampioenschap en het circuit rijden de piloten dan of zelfs ronden 
De tijd speelt geen rol meer; het is de plaats die telt Voor de startvolgorde 
worden niet de tijden bij elkaar opgeteld maar wel de daarmee verbonden plaatsen in de 
bewuste reeks Wie in een reeks de snelste tijd neerzet krijgt voor die reeks één 
punt de tweede twee en zo voort Wie in de twee eerste reeksen de snelste 
tijd neerzet heeft dus sowieso de pole in de Afinale want niemand kan nog beter 
doen dan twee punten en hoeft dus in principe de derde reeks niet meer te 
rijden Wie uitvalt krijgt punten wie niet start en wie gediskwalificeerd wordt Deze punten kunnen 
niet in rekening gebracht worden voor de startvolgorde van de finales vandaar dat twee tijden 
noodzakelijk zijn Voor de uitslag van de wedstrijd telt enkel de volgorde waarin men de 
finishlijn overschrijdt; de resultaten van de reeksen spelen geen rol meer Soms onder andere in 
Duitsland en GrootBrittannië wordt er na de eigenlijke finales nog een zogenaamde superfinale gereden Deze 
race verloopt zoals een gewone finale maar de starters kunnen uit de verschillende divisies komen 
Degenen die aan de start mogen komen zijn immers de acht of zelfs tien start 
in vier rijen piloten die tijdens de reeksen de snelste rondetijden hebben gedraaid Tijdens een 
rallycrosswedstrijd worden signalen gegeven door middel van vlaggen De afstand tussen twee vlaggenposten is in 
principe maximaal meter maximaal want de posten moeten zo liggen dat de officials van één 
post die van de vorige en die van de volgende kunnen zien De startprocedure wordt 
in principe in gang gezet met de roodwit geblokte uitzonderlijk de nationale of de groene 
afvlaggen gebeurt met de zwartwit geblokte eventueel in combinatie met rood of gezwaaid geel waar 
de piloten het circuit verlaten en terug de paddock induiken De start wordt gegeven door 
middel van startlichten Als deze om één of andere reden niet gebruikt zouden kunnen worden 
wordt de start ook met een vlag gegeven met name de nationale vlag van het 
land waar het circuit gelegen is Deze vlag kan ook gebruikt worden om de individuele 
rijders te laten starten bij de vrije training en de tijdtraining maar in dit geval 
kan ook gewoon de groene vlag gebruikt worden Voor de start moet het circuit vrijgegeven 
worden Dat gebeurt door aan elke vlaggenpost groen te vlaggen en eventueel aan de eerste 
eerst rood en dan roodwit te zwaaien De gele vlag betekent dat er een voertuig 
of voertuigonderdeel zich in de gevarenzone bevindt Enkel en stil betekent voertuig in zandbak enkel 
gezwaaid betekent onderdeel op baan dubbel gezwaaid betekent voertuig op de baan Deze vlag wordt 
gegeven aan de laatste post voor het obstakel bij de eerste passage Bij de tweede 
steeds enkel en stilgehouden daarna gaat de vlag weg tenzij de situatie intussen veranderd is 
Indien een voertuig zich tussen de finish en de eerste vlaggenpost bevindt mag er tijdens 
de laatste ronde niet voor gevlagd worden omdat het zich dan buiten wedstrijd bevindt Onder 
gele vlag moeten de piloten hun snelheid matigen en zich klaarhouden om eventueel uit te 
wijken Inhalen is dan ook verboden Met de rode vlag legt men de wedstrijd stil 
bijvoorbeeld omdat een gecrasht voertuig te gevaarlijk staat of omdat een valse start werd genomen 
De zwarte vlag met nummerbord betekent dat de piloot met het getoonde startnummer voor die 
reeks gediskwalificeerd wordt De diagonaal verdeelde zwartwitte vlag is een waarschuwing voor onsportief gedrag en 
wordt ook getoond aan wie een valse start maakt Tweemaal deze vlag in dezelfde reeks 
betekent zwart Zwart met een oranje bol wordt getoond aan piloten wiens voertuig bijvoorbeeld na 
een aanrijding een zwaar defect vertoont dat voor de piloot of voor anderen een gevaar 
betekent of zou kunnen betekenen Deze piloot moet dan zo snel mogelijk de paddock inrijden 
De blauwe vlag wordt getoond aan een piloot als hem een snellere wagen volgt Stilgehouden 
betekent dit gewoon voorbij laten gezwaaid voorbij laten of u wordt gestraft De witte vlag 
wordt getoond aan de snellere piloot die achter deze tragere wagen rijdt Tot slot is 
er nog de geelrood verticaal gestreepte vlag Deze wordt door de starter getoond voor de 
wagens vertrekken en betekent dat er olie op de baan ligt De starter wijst ook 
aan waar op de baan dit het geval is Ook als delen van de baan 
tussen twee reeksen met water besproeid zijn bijvoorbeeld de onverharde delen om minder stof te 
hebben wordt deze vlag bij de start getoond aan de eersten die na het besproeien 
starten Soms wordt ze ook getoond aan de laatste post voor de bewuste plek en 
zeker als de olie er pas tijdens de race terecht is gekomen bijvoorbeeld van een 
gecrasht voertuig dat nog op eigen kracht naar een veiligere stopplaatsde paddock is gereden Er 
zijn ook nog enkele nietofficiële vlaggen Dit zijn dan vlaggen die in andere autosportdisciplines wel 
gebruikt worden en uitzonderlijk ook bij rallycross te zien zijn Een voorbeeld is de gele 
vlag met een zwart kruis die gebruikt wordt om het ingaan van de laatste ronde 
aan te geven heel zelden wordt hiervoor ook de witte vlag gebruikt Op de meeste 
circuits wordt echter aan de finish het aantal nog te rijden ronden aangegeven verplicht voor 
FIAwedstrijden waardoor deze vlag eigenlijk overbodig is en zelfs waar er geen teller staat wordt 
deze vlag nog niet erg frequent gebruikt Indien een piloot een vlag negeert beslist de 
wedstrijdleiding over zijn straf Dit kan een geldboete zijn maar meestal resulteert het negeren van 
een andere vlag dan de zwarte in een zwarte vlag en het negeren van de 
zwarte vlag in een uitsluiting van de race Voor de klassementen worden de punten toegekend 
aan de hand van de einduitslag De puntenverdeling verloopt als volgt de winnaar krijgt punten 
de tweede de derde en zo verder Voor sommige nationale kampioenschappen onder andere het Zweedse 
worden daar ook nog eens extra punten van de tijdtraining bijgeteld voor de beste; voor 
de tweede en voor de derde Bij de meeste kampioenschappen mogen de slechtste resultaten aantal 
afhankelijk van het aantal wedstrijden meestal één of twee geschrapt worden Om een wedstrijd voor 
een kampioenschap te kunnen laten meetellen moeten er minstens deelnemers zijn Soms wordt dit aangepast 
voor nationale kampioenschappen Zo is bijvoorbeeld voor het Belgisch kampioenschap het minimumaantal starters niet maar 
en voor het Oostenrijks kampioenschap is het zelfs maar Ook verloopt de puntentelling voor het 
Oostenrijks kampioenschap als volgt Op februari werd op het Lydden Circuit van Wootton vaak ook 
Lydden Hill genoemd tussen Dover en Canterbury in Engeland voor een televisieprogramma van de omroep 
ITV de eerste rallycrosswedstrijd ooit gereden – onder uitgenodigde rallypiloten Al snel bleef dit circuit 
in gebruik voor rallycross en werden er ook bij andere verharde circuits zoals Croft Circuit 
en Cadwell Park onverharde stukken aangelegd voor rallycross De eerste rallycrosswedstrijd op het vasteland vond 
op juni plaats op militair terrein in de hei nabij Venlo Op april werd het 
eerste circuit speciaal voor rallycross gemaakt in gebruik genomen het Eurocircuit in Valkenswaard Het eerste 
nog officieuze EK werd gereden in De wedstrijden vonden plaats in Oostenrijk Duitsland België Nederland 
Engeland twee wedstrijden en Zweden race oorspronkelijk in Frankrijk gepland Het jaar daarop kwam Finland 
erbij Ook in richtten de organiserende autoclubs de ERA European Rallycross Association op Sinds is 
het EK van de ERA door de FIA Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile erkend en organiseert 
deze een eigen EK Nu nog is het zo dat de FIA het eigenlijke EK 
organiseert en dat een deel van die wedstrijden tevens de ERACup vormen Er zijn twee 
landen die het EK al elke keer te gast gehad hebben België en Zweden Ook 
zijn er drie circuits van de allereerste EKkalender waar nu nog steeds EKmanches doorgaan het 
Duivelsbergcircuit B het Eurocircuit NL en de Estering D De eer van het grootste aantal 
EKmanches gaat trouwens ook naar de Estering die er met uitzondering van en al elk 
jaar bij was in zelfs twee keer en dus niet naar een circuit in België 
of Zweden aangezien er in deze landen een tijd lang een beurtrol geweest is tussen 
de circuits die het EK ontvingen gegevens tot en met EK In Nederland is er 
één rallycrosscircuit met name het Eurocircuit in Valkenswaard Dat is overigens het eerste circuit ter 
wereld dat specifiek voor rallycross werd aangelegd ter vervanging van een nietpermanent circuit nabij Venlo 
Met het circuit kunnen verschillende namen verbonden worden maar eentje die zeker vermeld moet worden 
is de Noor Martin Schanche die er maar liefst keer de EKwedstrijd won en naar 
wie sinds enkele jaren het pleintje tussen het secretariaat en de cafetaria genoemd is Martin 
Schanche Plein Vroeger waren er ook circuits in Axel Goes en RillandBath maar deze circuits 
zijn intussen gesloten of omgebouwd voor andere disciplines Wat Nederlandse piloten betreft zijn naast Jan 
de Rooy en Piet Dam vooral Cees Teurlings Ko Kasse MarcJan Vlassak en Ron Snoeck 
en te noemen die diverse Europese titels haalden In België waren er ooit drie circuits 
het Mandescircuit in Ingelmunster gesloten het Glossocircuit in Arendonk en het Duivelsbergcircuit in Opgrimbie bij 
Maasmechelen al sinds juni in gebruik maar toen nog volledig onverhard; pas in kwamen de 
verharde stukken er Tegenwoordig mag enkel het laatste nog voor internationale wedstrijden gebruikt worden; voor 
regionale wedstrijden komt ook Arendonk nog in aanmerking Er zijn wel plannen voor de aanleg 
van een nieuw circuit in Lommel met de steun van piloot Ludo Helven en aan 
het circuit van Francorchamps deze plannen zijn opnieuw in de koelkast beland Ook in het 
Waalse Mettet is er groot interesse voor een nieuw rallycrosscircuit Op november vond er een 
wedstrijd plaats op het Circuit Jules Tacheny dat deels van de openbare weg gebruikmaakt en 
daar zal er in de komende jaaren misschien een permanent rallycrosscircuit met onverharde passages aangelegd 
worden Er zijn drie Belgen die een Europese titel in de wacht sleepten Tony Kuypers 
in de cup een divisie die niet meer bestaat voor het EK; in Ronny Scheveneels 
in divisie en Michaël De Keersmaecker in divisie en de RX Cup Ook de eerste 
eindzege in deze RX Cup ging naar een Belg met name Jos Sterkens De rallycrosspiloot 
bij uitstek in België was echter de tienvoudige rallycross kampioen de onderwijzer François Monten uit 
Mol Het Groothertogdom Luxemburg moet het zonder circuit stellen; er zijn dan ook geen rallycrosspiloten 
uit Luxemburg bekend Rallycross is zeer populair in Scandinavië Dat verklaart dan ook dat de 
twee grootmeesters van de Europese rallycross "His Kennyness" Kenneth Hansen recordhouder qua aantal Europese titels 
hij behaalde zijn veertiende in en "Mister Rallycross" Martin Schanche met Europese titels tweede uit 
Zweden respectievelijk Noorwegen komen En ook vele andere Scandinavische rallycrossers doen het goed bv Matti 
Alamäki uit Finland die vijf EKtitels behaalde en zijn landgenoot Jussi Pinomäki met twee EKtitels 
De eerste wedstrijd in Scandinavië vond in Zweden plaats op oktober op het motocrosscircuit van 
Hedemora Winnaar was de nog steeds rijdende Zweed Per Eklund Ook in Frankrijk is rallycross 
enorm populair Toch zijn er eerder weinig Fransen die het EK rijden onder andere omwille 
van de andere divisieindeling maar zij die het doen bijvoorbeeld JeanLuc Pailler in divisie komen 
gewoonlijk toch goed mee Op september vond de eerste wedstrijd plaats op het toen nog 
volledig onverharde oude circuit van Lohéac bij Rennes In Lohéac is er trouwens nog altijd 
een circuit al is het huidige sinds met jokerlap met jump die echter door de 
FIA werd afgekeurd als onveilig en daarom in werd aangepast pas in in gebruik genomen 
In Duitsland heeft rallycross een dipje meegemaakt maar het begint terug beter te gaan In 
waren er nog slechts twee circuits in gebruik de Estering in Buxtehude waar in ook 
de allereerste Duitse rallycrosswedstrijd plaatsvond en de Gründautalring in Gründau naast het autocrosscircuit "Am Matschenberg" 
Op de Nürburgring wordt geen rallycross meer gereden en ook de Auering en het circuit 
van Stadtallendorf zijn niet meer in gebruik De Flämingring die enkele keren op de kalender 
stond is zelfs nooit voor een rallycrosswedstrijd gebruikt En ook de Gründautalring die hoe langer 
hoe meer verharde stukken heeft gekregen en nu zelfs volledig verhard is is dus geen 
echt rallycrosscircuit meer In maart is echter een nieuwe omloop in gebruik genomen op het 
terrein van de Motorsport Arena Oschersleben dus niet aan het autocrosscircuit "An den sieben Bergen" 
eveneens in Oschersleben Daarnaast wil men op de militaire luchthaven Borstel van Stendal ook een 
nieuw circuit openen de eigenlijke opening was gepland voor de zomer van maar waarschijnlijk zal 
het ten vroegste in het seizoen in gebruik genomen worden en het autocrosscircuit van Schlüchtern 
zou in de toekomst ook enkele verharde stukken kunnen krijgen Doel is Duitsland terug op 
de rallycrosswereldkaart te plaatsen het aantal piloten is er nu vrij laag voor zo'n groot 
land en goede prestaties op Europees vlak zijn dan ook zeer zeldzaam In Oostenrijk zijn 
er nog drie circuits het PS Racing Center in Greinbach dat ook voor de EKmanches 
gebruikt wordt de Wachauring in Melk heette oorspronkelijk Leruring en is nu in de eerste 
plaats testcentrum van de ÖAMTC en de op internationaal vlak niet echt populaire Nordring heette 
in het begin Britaxring in Fuglau bij Horn Veel Europese toppers zijn er niet zoals 
vroeger bv drievoudig EKwinnaar Franz Wurz de vader van rijder Alexander Wurz maar toch is 
de rallycross er nog populairder dan in sommige andere landen waaronder Zwitserland Ook daar is 
er ooit rallycross geweest maar het aantal wedstrijden is op de vingers van één hand 
te tellen De eerste vond plaats in op het eerder kleine circuit van Lignières In 
de OostEuropese landen moet rallycross het opnemen tegen autocross die daar veel populairder is In 
sommige landen trekt de rallycross toch ook aan in anderen veel minder Toch zijn er 
een aantal goede circuits zoals de EKcircuits in Słomczyn Polen en Česká Lípa Tsjechië Net 
omdat rallycross het er tegen autocross moet opnemen zijn veel van de andere circuits vooral 
in de Baltische staten er eigenlijk autocrosscircuits volledig onverhard behalve de start of circuits met 
een rallycross en een autocrossvariant In Spanje ooit waren er EKmanches op het Circuito de 
Sils bij Gerona en Italië kende EKmanches op de Rallypista Santo Spirito in GropelloCairoli bij 
Pavia is er van rallycross amper nog sprake In Portugal daarentegen is rallycross nog wel 
vrij populair circuits te Lousada Montalegre Sever do Vouga en Castelo Branco + aanleg van 
een nieuw circuit in Baltar Op de Britse eilanden zijn de meeste rallycrosscircuits asfaltcircuits waar 
stukken onverhard bij aangelegd zijn Mondello Park in Ierland en onder andere Lydden Croft en 
Knockhill in GrootBrittannië Op Europees niveau zie je zeer weinig Britse en Ierse deelnemers onder 
andere omwille van de andere regels voor de wagens gewicht etc en omdat er sinds 
enkele jaren geen EKmanches meer georganiseerd worden aan de overkant van het Kanaal Wel vindt 
op het circuit van Croft jaarlijks de Superprix plaats een wedstrijd die in de eerste 
plaats gehouden wordt tussen de Europese en verschillende nationale kampioenen Zoals bij de meeste autosporten 
is er ook bij rallycross een indeling in divisies Hier volgt de indeling zoals ze 
tegenwoordig voor het door de FIA georganiseerde Europees kampioenschap geldt Voor de nationale kampioenschappen kan 
ze aangepast worden maar meestal is ze hier wel op gebaseerd Supercars vierwielaangedreven toerismewagens met 
een turbomotor van max startnummers Super toerismewagens met voorwielaandrijving startnummers Touringcars tweewielaangedreven productiewagens startnummers Vanaf 
komt hier een 'Cup'klasse startnummers bij met wagens met achterwielaandrijving en opgevat op basis van 
de technische reglementen van divisie Het is de bedoeling dat deze klasse binnen enkele jaren 
de "uitstervende" divisie zal gaan vervangen Er zijn ook een aantal zogenaamde "supportraces" Welke voertuigen 
daaraan deelnemen verschilt van wedstrijd tot wedstrijd Zo is er bij het Nederlands kampioenschap de 
Formula RallyRacing rallycross gereden met autocrossbuggy's Ook zijn er wedstrijden voor jonge startende piloten die 
nog geen licentie en soms zelfs nog geen rijbewijs hebben In België en Nederland mogen 
zij hun eigen wedstrijden rijden met Ford RSTwagens in Frankrijk konden ze dat tot en 
met met Citroën voordien Citroën Saxo's Daarnaast zijn er ook nog races met in Nederland 
genaamd en af en toe zakken de typisch Scandinavische Supernationals ook af naar België of

de Hulk De film bestaat in feite uit twee kortere films Hulk vs Wolverine en 
Hulk vs Thor De films werden getekend in de Japanse studio Beide films kregen van 
de MPAA de rating Department H stuurt Wolverine eropuit om een mysterieus beest dat bij 
het Amerikaanse leger bekendstaat als de Hulk op te sporen Hij zou zich ophouden in 
de Canadese wildernis Onderweg is hij getuige van de vernielingen die de Hulk in een 
klein plaatsje heeft aangericht Wolverine vindt het alter ego van de Hulk Bruce Banner bij 
de oever van een meer Hij ondervraagt hem op brute wijze nadat hij ontdekt dat 
Banner dezelfde geur heeft als de Hulk Wolverine gaat echter te ver en Banner verandert 
in de Hulk De twee gaan de strijd aan met elkaar maar geen van beide 
lijkt de overhand te kunnen krijgen Het gevecht wordt onderbroken wanneer ze beide met een 
verdovingspijl worden neergeschoten door Team X bestaande uit Deadpool Omega Red Lady Deathstrike en Sabretooth 
Vervolgens ziet men via een flashback hoe Wolverine door Weapon X werd gevangen en zijn 
adamantiumskelet kreeg Wolverine wordt uit zijn verdoving gewekt in een Weapon Xhoofdkwartier Hier wordt hij 
begroet door Professor Thornton een van de geleerden die verantwoordelijk was voor Wolverines operatie Hij 
onthult dat zij al weken achter de hulk aan zaten en dat Banner door hun 
toedoen steeds in de Hulk veranderde Nu Thornton de Hulk gevangen heeft wil hij hem 
als wapen inzetten door Banners geheugen te wissen Wolverine ontsnapt en vindt Banner Hij dwingt 
hem weer in de Hulk te veranderen waarna ze zich samen een weg uit het 
Weapon Xhoofdkwartier vechten Uiteindelijk vernietigen ze de hele basis Naderhand hervatten Hulk en Wolverine hun 
oorspronkelijke strijd Wie deze strijd wint wordt niet onthuld Eeuwenlang heeft Odin het rijk Asgard 
beschermd maar elk jaar moet hij een week rust nemen om weer op krachten te 
komen In die week proberen veel van Asgards vijanden het rijk over te nemen Ze 
worden altijd verslagen door Thor en de andere Asgardianen maar ten koste van enkele levens 
Dit jaar heeft Loki een alternatief plan om Asgard tijdens Odins rustperiode te veroveren Hij 
ontvoert Banner met behulp van Enchantress voorheen Thors vriendin Amora en brengt hem naar Asgard 
Daar laat hij hem veranderen in de Hulk Vervolgens spreekt Enchantress een spreuk uit die 
Banner en de Hulk van elkaar scheidt en Loki controle over de hulk geeft HulkLoki 
arriveert bij de poort en verslaat de Warriors Three Thor gaat de strijd aan met 
de Hulk wanneer hij beseft dat deze door Loki wordt beheerst Na een lang gevecht 
gebruikt Thor zijn hamer om Loki en de Hulk weer van elkaar te scheiden De 
Hulk is nu echter onbeheersbaar omdat hij geen alter ego meer heeft en hij doodt 
Thor bijna Enchantress die nog steeds van Thor houdt komt echter tussenbeide Ze brengt hem 
weer bij zijn positieven en vertelt hem waar Loki zich bevindt Aangekomen op die plek 
blijkt dat Loki Banner heeft gedood Amora kan de twee daarom niet meer samensmelten en 
de Hulk terug naar de aarde sturen Loki beseft ondertussen dat de Hulk nu ook 
voor hem een bedreiging vormt en hij besluit Thor te helpen Zelfs met z’n tweeën 
kunnen ze echter niet tegen de Hulk in zijn huidige vorm op Uiteindelijk dalen ze 
af in de Hel om Hela om hulp te vragen Ondertussen komt Banners ziel in 
een soort hiernamaals dat eruitziet als de normale wereld In deze wereld is hij getrouwd 
met Elizabeth Ross en heeft hij een zoon genaamd Bruce Jr Zijn verblijf in deze 
wereld wordt onderbroken wanneer Hela hem naar haar troon brengt waar Loki en Thor wachten 
Banner wil Asgard echter niet helpen Loki overtuigt Hela daarom om de Hulk ook daarheen 
te halen Ze stemt daarmee in en teleporteert Hulk naar zich toe Daarmee redt ze 
op het laatste moment Odin Banner versmelt weer met de Hulk en wordt door Hela

Bij nieuw ontwikkelde computerprogrammatuur is er aanvankelijk sprake van een testfase waarbij gekeken wordt of 
het programma aankan waar het voor bedoeld is Daar zijn verschillende methoden voor Voor een 
dynamische expliciete test wordt een aantal testgevallen opgesteld met de daarbij behorende verwachte uitkomsten Nadat 
deze testgevallen zijn geaccordeerd worden deze in het te testen systeem ingevoerd Voor het opzetten 
van een dergelijk testgeval kan gebruikgemaakt worden van al dan niet geformaliseerde testspecificatietechnieken Dit invoeren 
kan op verschillende manieren plaatsvinden afhankelijk van de omgeving en het type systeem Zo zullen 
in systemen met een user interface zoals een Graphical User Interface GUI de waarden en 
acties via het scherm worden ingevoerd syntactische test terwijl bij een systeem zonder user interface 
gebruikgemaakt zal moeten worden van hulpmiddelen zoals stubs en drivers of gespecialiseerde testbanken In alle 
gevallen geldt dat bij een dynamische expliciete test de testgevallen in het systeem worden ingevoerd 
en de verwachte resultaten in een rapport worden vastgelegd Voor diverse dynamische tests kunnen hulpmiddelen 
worden gebruikt om de tests te automatiseren Denk hierbij aan Capture Playback tools voor uitvoeren 
van functionele tests op systemen met een user interface Naast een dynamische expliciete test bestaan 
er ook dynamische impliciete tests Dit betreft het vinden van fouten in de software zonder 
dat daar specifieke testgevallen voor gemaakt zijn De fouten worden gedurende een andere expliciete test

Tatiana Romanova Tanya voor haar vrienden is een personage uit Ian Flemings James Bondroman From 
Russia with Love en de gelijknamige film From Russia with Love Ze wordt gespeeld door 
de Italiaanse actrice Daniela Bianchi Romanova werkt in het boek voor de SMERSH Als SPECTRE 
van plan is James Bond te elimineren om zichzelf weer op de kaart te zetten 
gebruiken ze Romanova als hun lokaas Agent Rosa Klebb vertrekt naar Istanboel voor een ontmoeting 
met Romanova ze krijgt de opdracht James Bond naar Istanboel te lokken en te doen 
alsof ze verliefd op hem is Romanova moet zorgen dat Bond de Russische Lektor decodeermachine 
in handen krijgen Dat SMERSH Bond wil doden vertellen ze haar niet Bond vertrekt naar 
Istanboel naar zijn contact Dakro Kerim Bey die hem dekking geeft bij zijn opdracht Als 
hij Tatiana eenmaal ontmoet probeert hij te zorgen dat ze vertelt waar de Lektor is 
als Bond de Lektor dankzij haar hulp en die van Kerim Bey in handen krijgt 
reizen ze samen met Kerim Bey terug naar Londen via de OriëntExpress maar wat ze 
niet weten is dat de SMERSH' Belangrijkste Executioner Donovan 'Red' Grant ook aan boord is 
Grant vermoordt Kerim Bey en op dat moment verdenkt Bond Tatiana dat zij meewerkt aan 
deze operatie Als ze alweer een stuk verder zijn ontmoeten ze Grant Bond ontdekt dat 
hij de orders van SMERSH heeft gekregen om Bond en Romanova te elimineren en er 
zo met de Lektor vandoor te gaan Bond weet Grant hierna te vermoorden en na 
nog een lange reis komen ze veilig terecht in Parijs In Parijs is Rosa Klebb 
weer terug die nog een laatste poging waagt Bond te elimineren en de Lektor te 
stelen in Bonds hotelkamer Klebb beschikt over dodelijke spikes met een dodelijk gif die uit 
haar schoenen komen en valt hiermee Bond aan James Bond weet het gevecht bijna te 
winnen maar wordt geraakt door een van de Spikes uit Klebb haar schoen en valt 
zwaargewond neer Klebb wordt uiteindelijk gearresteerd door Bonds vriend René Mathis In de films was 
haar rol niet veel anders dan die in het boek Ze werkte hier voor het 
Rode Leger Als SPECTRE besloten heeft James Bond te elimineren sturen ze Rosa Klebb naar 
Tatiana die haar de orders geeft te doen alsof ze verliefd is op Bond via 
een foto van hem om hem naar Istanboel te lokken ze moet Bond helpen de 
Britse decodeermachine de LEKTOR in handen te krijgen Klebb doet zich hier echter voor als 
een agent van SMERSH Bond vertrekt naar Istanboel waar hij komt bij zijn contact Kerim 
Bey die hem vertelt over Romanova Nadat Bond met Kerim Bey erin geslaagd is de 
moordenaar Krillencu te doden treft hij 's avonds laat Tatiana volledig naakt in zijn bed 
aan Na een korte ontmoeting hebben de twee seks met elkaar maar wat ze niet 
doorhebben is dat hun romantische avond gefilmd wordt Later komt Bond er via haar achter 
waar de LEKTOR is en hoe ze hem kunnen stelen Bond laat het gebouw waar 
de LEKTOR is aanvallen zodat zij de machine kunnen terugstelen Ze gaan dan samen met 
Kerim Bey de Oriënt Express op om de machine terug te krijgen maar wat ze 
niet weten is dat SPECTRE's belangrijkste Executioner Donald 'Red' Grant met hen meereist Als ze 
een tijdje op de trein zitten beleven ze samen een rustige romantische tijd met elkaar 
maar als Bond haar beveelt haar jurkje uit te trekken en haar normale kleren aan 
te trekken om wat te gaan drinken met Kerim Bey blijkt het dat hij omgekomen 
is Bond wil weten wie Tatiana de orders gegeven heeft maar Tatiana zwijgt echter voor 
een hele tijd Bond ontmoet later in Zagreb Red Grant als de trein tijdelijk gestopt 
is Hij dineert die avond met Grant waarbij Tatiana iets in haar drinken krijgt van 
Grant wat ze echter niet doorheeft Ze valt die avond al snel in slaap dankzij 
Grant Bond ontdekt die avond dat Grant voor SPECTRE werkt en dat hij de orders 
van Rosa Klebb gekregen heeft Bond te doden en zo de LEKTOR in handen te 
krijgen Hij was het echter ook die Kerim Bey heeft laten omkomen Bond komt er 
in het gesprek achter dat Tatiana haar orders ook van Klebb kreeg Bond vermoordt Grant 
die avond en gaat met Tatiana de trein uit in Joegoslavië Als Tatiana de volgende 
dag weer klaarwakker is maakt ze mee dat Bond een helikopter aan zijn einde brengt 
Ze gaan verder in Triëst waar ze met een bootje proberen in Venetië te komen 
Dit lukt nadat ze een aanval van SPECTRE hebben weten te verijdelen Later in Venetië 
probeert Rosa Klebb nog een laatste poging te doen de LEKTOR in handen te krijgen 
Terwijl Bond aan de telefoon zit wordt hij onder schot gehouden door Klebb Tatiana krijgt 
de orders ervandoor te gaan met de LEKTOR zodat Klebb een einde kan maken aan 
Bond Maar Tatiana slaat het pistool weg met de machine Als Bond wil aanvallen gebruikt 
Klebb haar schoenen waar dodelijke spikes uitkomen Bond houdt haar tegen met een stoel en 
Tatiana weet bij het pistool te komen en Klebb te doden Ten slotte varen Bond 
en Tatiana met hun bootje door de Venetiaanse kanalen waarbij de film eindigt met een 
zoen tussen de twee op hun bootje waarbij hij de comprimerende film die opgenomen is 
Süper Lig was het drieënvijftigste seizoen van de Süper Lig De competitie had vanaf een 
nieuwe sponsor en naamgever SporToto Süper Lig was de officiële naam die vrijwel uitsluitend in 
de media werd gebruikt terwijl de fans gewoon van Süper Lig spraken Deze veelbesproken jaargang 
begon op augustus en eindigde officieel op mei maar aan de groene tafel is dit 
seizoen in nog steeds niet afgelopen Dat heeft alles te maken met een enorm matchfixingschandaal 
rondom kampioen Fenerbahçe SK Na wedstrijden had herfstkampioen Trabzonspor een voorsprong van punten op Bursaspor 
en op Fenerbahçe SK en leek met toppers als Burak Yılmaz en Umut Bulut in 
de gelederen de titel voor het eerst sinds weer eens naar de boorden van Zwarte 
Zee te halen Tijdens de terugronde begon Fenerbahçe SK echter aan een imposante en voor 
onmogelijk gehouden inhaalrace de club won zestien wedstrijden en speelde er een gelijk Zowel Trabzonspor 
als Fenerbahçe SK eindigde op punten maar het onderlinge resultaat in Trabzon in İstanbul gaf 
de doorslag Fenerbahçe SK was voor de achttiende maal in de historie kampioen De vreugde 
over deze achttiende titel zou echter van korte duur zijn op juli werd Feners voorzitter 
Aziz Yıldırım een zakenman met een dubieuze reputatie gearresteerd op verdenking van omkoping bij wedstrijden 
het uitdelen van aanmoedigingspremies en het bezit van meerdere ongedocumenteerde vuurwapens In verband met het 
omkopingsschandaal werden in totaal personen aangehouden In de uiteindelijke aanklacht tegen Aziz Yıldırım was sprake 
van negentien wedstrijden waarin hij onder meer aanmoedigingspremies aan in totaal veertien clubs zou hebben 
Hangende het onderzoek sloot de UEFA Fenerbahçe SK één dag voor de loting van de 
groepswedstrijden in de Champions League gedurende één seizoen uit van Europees voetbal; Trabzonspor dat zich 
al geplaatst had voor de groepswedstrijden van de Europa League nam de opengevallen plek in 
Op juli kwam Aziz Yıldırım voorwaardelijk vrij en ging in hoger beroep Fenerbahçe SK mocht 
in wel meedoen aan de voorronden van de Champions League en later het hoofdtoernooi van 
de Europa League maar omdat de Türkiye Futbol Federasyonu niet echt haast maakte met het 
onderzoek naar het matchfixingschandaal schorste de UEFA Fenerbahçe SK in opnieuw nu voor de duur 
van twee seizoenen De Sarı Kanaryalar Gele Kanaries gingen nog wel in hoger beroep bij 
het Court of Arbitration for Sport kortweg CAS maar dat mocht niet baten Voor de 
UEFA stond Yıldırıms schuld vast en de Europese voetbalbond drong nu aan op een spoedige 
beslissing van de Turkse bond; er was zelfs sprake van het verplicht inleveren van de 
titel van en van verplichte degradatie naar de Lig Sommige websites lopen alvast vooruit op 
de zaken en kennen het kampioenschap van alvast toe aan Trabzonspor maar zover is het 
nog niet tot er een definitief oordeel is geveld gaat dit overzicht ervan uit dat 
Fenerbahçe SK de kampioen van is Topscorer van de liga werd Alex de Souza met 
doelpunten waarvan hij negen maal vanaf elf meter mocht aanleggen De twee andere leden van 
de Üç Büyükler Grote Drie ging het in het seizoen beduidend minder goed Beşiktaş JK 
werd in de competitie ondanks enkele topaankopen en de aanwezigheid van trainer Bernd Schuster slechts 
vijfde maar won wel de bekerfinale door de strafschoppen tegen İstanbul BB beter te nemen 
Ook aan deze bekercampagne hing echter een zweem van omkoping zodat de Kara kartallar Zwarte 
Adelaars de gewonnen beker tijdelijk teruggaven aan de Türkiye Futbol Federasyonu; of de club deze 
beker terugkrijgt is anno nog steeds niet duidelijk; wel werd Beşiktaş JK dat jaar voor 
één seizoen uitgesloten van Europees voetbal Ook Galatasaray SK was het seizoen met trainer Frank 
Rijkaard vol hoge verwachtingen begonnen maar op oktober werd deze vervangen door Gheorghe Hagi Ook 
hij kon in zijn derde periode bij de club echter niet overtuigen en op maart 
moest hij op zijn beurt plaats maken voor Bülent Ünder Intussen had de club halverwege 
het seizoen wel het oude Ali Sami Yenstadion verlaten en op januari de gloednieuwe Türk 
Telekom Arena die plaats bood aan toeschouwers betrokken Die zagen dat de Aslanlar Leeuwen dat 
jaar niet verder kwamen dan een beschamende achtste plaats Op juli nam Antalyaspor de naam 
van de sponsor op in de clubnaam en speelde vanaf die datum onder de naam 
Medical Park Antalyaspor Geheel nieuw in de Süper Lig dit jaar was Bucaspor een club 
uit de İzmirse wijk Buca; de club hield het niet langer dan één jaar vol 
en neemt op de Eeuwige ranglijst van de Süper Lig een bescheiden plaats in Terug 
van weggeweest waren Lardemir DÇ Karabükspor en Konyaspor; laatstgenoemde club verdween ook nu weer na 
één seizoen De derde degradant was Kasımpaşa SK Het gat tussen de nummer en de 
drie degradanten was al snel geslagen dus de degradatiestrijd was dit jaar niet zo spannend 
als de afgelopen seizoenen Na het seizoen zal ook Konyaspor de naam van de sponsor 
in de clubnaam integreren en vanaf dan als Torku Konyaspor door het leven gaan VJ

van Bursaspor voor aanvang van de wedstrijd tegen Beşiktaş JK vernielingen aan in de binnenstad 
van Bursa; de wedstrijd werd niet gespeeld maar Beşiktaş JK kreeg een reglementaire toebedeeld Bursaspor 
werd veroordeeld tot het spelen van zes thuiswedstrijden buiten het eigen stadion; bovendien waren fans 
van de club niet welkom bij de eerstvolgende drie uitwedstrijden De promovendi die dit seizoen

Lady in Cement is een Amerikaanse neo noirfilm uit onder regie van Gordon Douglas De 
film is gebaseerd op het gelijknamig boek uit van Marvin H Albert en is het 
vervolg op de film Tony Rome Destijds werd hij in Nederland uitgebracht onder de titel 
Een blok aan mooie benen Particulier detective Tony Rome stort zich in de decadente en 
corrupte society van rijk Miami Tijdens een duiktocht treft hij het lijk van een naakte 
vrouw aan met beide voeten in een blok cement Dit bezorgt de door gokken berooide 
speurder weer een paar opdrachten die hem in contact en in botsing brengen met onder 
andere Waldo Gronski een gangsterkolos met een gouden hart; Kit Forrester een zwaar drinkende en 
minnende miljonair; Al Mungar een welgestelde gangster met zijn aanhang in verdorven nachtclubs; en Arnie 
Sherwin de politieinspecteur Er worden diverse moorden gepleegd waarna Tony en Kit moeten bewijzen dat 
zij hier niet schuldig aan zijn Ten tijde van het maken van de film had 
hoofdrolspeler Frank Sinatra als filmster en zanger dusdanig veel macht dat hij als medeproducent van 
deze film veel zeggenschap had over de productie Zo opperde hij dat de film op 
locatie in Miami werd opgenomen zodat hij tussen opnames door kon optreden in een hotel 
in de stad Raquel Welch vertelde in een later interview dat ze zo onder de 
indruk was van tegenspeler Frank Sinatra dat dit ten koste ging van haar De film 
bracht in de Verenigde Staten niet genoeg geld in het laatje en ook de pers 
was gematigd enthousiast over het eindproduct In Nederland kreeg de film overwegend positieve reacties Zo 
noemde recensent van het Algemeen Handelsblad het een "klassieke gangsterfilm en een harde spiegel van 
de Amerikaanse maatschappij" met "fenomenale regie" van Gordon Criticus van De Volkskrant noemde het "een 
lekkere film" met "een juiste dosering toffe grappen" en schreef met bewondering voor Gordon Douglas; 
"een vakman van Niet alle critici waren even enthousiast over het eindproduct Recensent van De 
Telegraaf had vooral bewondering voor het spel van Sinatra en schreef over het verhaal dat 
het "spannend" is maar "in het dozijn nauwelijks zou Criticus van De Waarheid voegde hieraan 
toe dat het "allemaal wel aardig is om te zien maar niet Recensent van Het 
Parool schreef met bewondering voor Douglas' "losse filmstijl die de toeschouwer ontspannen in zijn bioscoopstoel 
doet zakken In die houding vallen hem levendige details een goed gebruik van de locaties 
een paar geslaagde bijrollen en vooral spitse woordgrapjes in de dialoog op maar achter die 
kleine kwaliteiten aan de oppervlakte zit een leegte die hem overduidelijk maakt dat hij in 
het gebeuren echt niet hoeft te Een negatieve review kwam van recensent van De Tijd 
die kritisch schreef over de "merkwaardige figuren die typerend zijn voor de tijd van hippie's 
en homo's waarin we leven" alsmede de regie van Gordon Douglas en het spel van 
Sinatra "De manier waarop Gordon Douglas het weinig samenhangende verhaal heeft verfilmd kan moeilijk dynamisch 
worden genoemd Maar juist het wat trage tempo en het slome spel van Sinatra hebben 
na een poosje een hypnotische uitwerking die de toeschouwer des te ontvankelijker maakt voor de

Emiliania huxleyi is een eencellige alg die behoort tot de coccolithoforen De soort komt als 
fytoplankton wereldwijd zeer algemeen voor in vrijwel alle zeeën en oceanen De wetenschappelijke naam is 
een verwijzing naar Thomas Henry Huxley die een belangrijke bijdrage heeft geleverd aan het eerste 
onderzoek naar coccolithoforen in de eeuw Onder de microscoop heeft het organisme wat weg van 
een bol bedekt met iets over elkaar liggende ananasringen door de ringvormige calcietschildjes met een 
regelmatige structuur maar het wordt nog geen tiende millimeter in doorsnede Ondanks zijn geringe grootte 
vormt de soort regelmatig uitgestrekte blooms in het oppervlaktewater van zeeën zodat de algen vanuit 
de ruimte zijn waar te nemen het feit dat calciet sterk licht terugkaatst heeft hier 
overigens ook mee te maken Emiliania huxleyi past zich zoals veel microorganismen aan aan de 
omstandigheden door bepaalde stoffen in meer of juist mindere mate aan te maken Bij deze 
algjes echter worden zogenaamde alkenonen aangemaakt vetachtige zeer bestendige stoffen Met name dat laatste is 
zeer interessant gebleken omdat de alkenonen in stand blijven en kunnen worden aangetroffen in sedimenten 
waardoor de levensomstandigheden van het algje gedurende miljoenen jaren als het ware opgeslagen zijn in 
het sediment Bij warmer zeewater maakt de alg alkenonen aan met twee dubbele bindingen tweevoudig 
onverzadigd bij koelere temperaturen drie dubbele bindingen drievoudig onverzadigd hierdoor is de soort een belangrijke

Damwoude De Bonifatiuskerk werd omstreeks gebouwd en is een van de oudste Friese kerken die 
van rode baksteen is gebouwd De bakstenen muren zijn weer tevoorschijn gekomen na de restauratie 
in de zestiger jaren van de eeuw toen de pleisterlaag van de kerk werd verwijderd 
De oorspronkelijke romaanse spaarnissen afgewisseld met kleine rondboogvensters zijn goed onder de dakrand van de 
zijmuren te zien Oorspronkelijk had de kerk een ronde koorafsluiting die waarschijnlijk in de eeuw 
is verwijderd De toren is vrijwel gelijk met de kerk gebouwd en dateert uit de 
eeuw Wel is het oorspronkelijke helmdak van de toren later vervangen door een zadeldak Ook

Het gebied ligt voor een belangrijk deel in de gemeente Oss en voor een klein 
deel in de gemeente Grave Het natuurgebied bestaat uit delen van de Keentse Uiterwaard en 
de Lage Wijth welke buiten de meander ligt Het betreft een relatief hooggelegen gebied dat 
altijd voor landbouwdoeleinden gebruikt is maar waarvan ha een natuurbestemming heeft gekregen Het gebied is 
tegenwoordig eigendom van de Stichting Brabants Landschap Daarnaast is zesenvijftig hectare aan poelen bosjes en

Maasverbetering in een meander van de Maas werd afgesneden De meander werd opgevuld met het 
materiaal dat bij de kanalisatiewerkzaamheden vrijkwam en een smalle waterloop bleef over Het oorspronkelijk Gelderse 
gebied werd aldus van zijn achterland afgesneden Het werd in ook bestuurlijk bij NoordBrabant gevoegd

Alcoholvergiftiging is het optreden van vergiftigingsverschijnselen door consumptie van alcoholhoudende dranken Strikt genomen zijn ook 
de symptomen van dronkenschap vergiftigingsverschijnselen maar met alcoholvergiftiging wordt het levensbedreigende stadium na dronkenschap bedoeld 
Wanneer het alcoholpromillage in het bloed à promille bereikt dit verschilt per persoon beginnen de 
symptomen van alcoholvergiftiging op te treden Naast de symptomen van 'gewone' dronkenschap zal de persoon 
slaperig suf of afwezig worden en telkens de neiging krijgen in te dutten Dit kan 
gepaard gaan met misselijkheid en hevig braken diarree of een algemeen gevoel van onwelzijn Meestal 
merkt men dat sprake is van alcoholvergiftiging doordat het slachtoffer niet meer reageert op prikkels 
zoals aanspreken aanroepen aangrijpen of op de wang tikken Andere symptomen zijn ademstilstand coma en 
eventueel hartstilstand Een alcoholvergiftiging kan dus dodelijk aflopen en er komen dan ook regelmatig incidenten 
voor waarbij dit gebeurt Wanneer men alcoholvergiftiging constateert of vermoedt zal men snel moeten handelen 
Indien het slachtoffer nog bij kennis is zal men moeten proberen hem te laten braken 
en bij kennis te houden voor hij het bewustzijn verliest Het is verder goed het 
slachtoffer gerust te stellen naar een koele of rustige ruimte te brengen en hem of 
haar geen verwijten te maken Sowieso moet iemand die dronken is of aan alcoholvergiftiging lijdt 
niet alleen worden gelaten Bij bewusteloosheid moet zo snel mogelijk een ambulance komen om het 
slachtoffer naar het ziekenhuis te vervoeren om zijn maag leeg te pompen Het is verstandig 
hem of haar in een stabiele zijligging te leggen met het oog op braken en 
vrijhouden van de luchtwegen Indien nodig en beschikbaar kan men het slachtoffer bedekken met een 
deken Mocht het slachtoffer niet meer ademen dan kan men het slachtoffer beademen Indien men 
niet weet hoe men moet beademen kan men het beste de komst van professionele hulpverlening 
afwachten Meestal komt het niet zo ver omdat iemand die zich zwaar bedrinkt op een 
gegeven moment misselijk wordt en moet overgeven waardoor hij wel moet ophouden met drinken Wanneer 
iemand echter in een hoog tempo sterke drank of likeur drinkt zal de alcohol echter

In de groepentheorie een deelgebied van de wiskunde is een karakteristieke ondergroep een ondergroep die 
onder alle automorfismen van de "oudergroep" is gesloten Dit is sterker dan het vereiste van 
de normale ondergroep en zwakker dan het vereiste van de volledig invariante ondergroep Voorbeelden van 
karakteristieke ondergroepen zijn de afgeleide ondergroep en het centrum van een groep Een karakteristieke ondergroep 
van een groep G is een ondergroep H die invariant is onder elk automorfisme van 
G Dat is als φ  G → G een groepsautomorfisme is dat wil zeggen een

geldt dat φx ∈ H Hieruit volgt dat In symbolen geeft men het feit dat

met het XYYsyndroom zijn steeds mannelijk Het wordt ook wel aangeduid als het Vlak na 
de geboorte is er bijna nooit iets afwijkends te zien of te merken aan een 
kind met XYYsyndroom In de jaren daarna zijn er wel kenmerken maar deze zijn zo 
algemeen dat er vaak geen reden is om verder onderzoek te doen Hierdoor bestaan er 
veel jongens met het syndroom die het nooit zullen weten Als het ontdekt wordt dan 
is dat vaak bij toeval De volgende kenmerken kunnen zich in meer of mindere mate

De gedwongen volksverhuizingen in de SovjetUnie kunnen grofweg worden onderverdeeld in de volgende categorieën deportatie 
van het "antisovjet"deel van de bevolking vaak "vijanden van het proletariaat" genoemd deportatie van naties 
arbeidskrachtverhuizingen en georganiseerde migraties in tegengestelde richtingen om etnisch gezuiverde gebieden te herbevolken In de 
meeste gevallen bestond de bestemming uit onderbevolkte en afgelegen gebieden De koelakken waren het bevolkingsdeel 
dat het meest gedeporteerd is Hervestiging van personen die officieel als koelak bestempeld werden ging 
door tot begin in verschillende golven Sommige etnische deportaties bijvoorbeeld die van de Polen na 
uit geannexeerde gebieden in het huidige WitRusland en WestOekraïne toentertijd OostPolen werden ook gerechtvaardigd met 
politieke en sociale redenen De deportatie van de WolgaDuitsers in vertoont enige gelijkenis met de 
internering van Japanners in de Verenigde Staten en Canada in dezelfde periode Een aantal religies 
met name de Jehova's getuigen werden als antisovjet bestempeld en hun aanhangers werden gedeporteerd De 
volledige verwijdering van potentieel onrust veroorzakende etnische groepen was een methode die Jozef Stalin veelvuldig 
toepaste tijdens zijn bewind De volgende etniciteiten werden in hun geheel gedeporteerd Koreanen WolgaDuitsers Balkaren 
Karatsjai Tsjetsjenen Ingoesjen Kalmukken Meschetische Turken Krimtataren mei Vrouwen die tot een van deze etniciteiten 
toebehoorden maar met mannen van een andere nietgedeporteerde etniciteit waren getrouwd mochten in hun woongebied 
blijven Omgekeerd moesten vrouwen van andere etniciteiten die met mannen van gedeporteerde etniciteiten waren getrouwd 
ofwel scheiden ofwel met hun man meereizen Een Duitse vrouw die met een Rus was 
getrouwd mocht dus blijven maar een Russische vrouw van een Duitser moest worden gedeporteerd Grote 
aantallen koelakken ongeacht hun nationaliteit werden verplaatst naar Siberië en CentraalAzië De meeste koelakken waren 
Russen gevolgd door Oekraïners Daarnaast werd een minderheid van de volgende etniciteiten gedeporteerd Polen Oekraïners 
Litouwers Letten Esten en Meer dan van mensen van deze afkomst bleven echter in hun 
woongebied leven behalve de Polen Joden werden nooit officieel gedeporteerd maar werden wel onder druk 
gezet om "vrijwillig" naar de Joodse autonome oblast te emigreren de meeste SovjetJoden slaagden er 
echter in aan deze gedwongen verhuizing te ontsnappen Kort voor tijdens en direct na de 
Tweede Wereldoorlog liet Stalin een serie deportaties op grote schaal uitvoeren die de etnische kaart 
van de SovjetUnie ingrijpend beïnvloedde miljoen personen werden naar Siberië en CentraalAziatische republieken gedeporteerd Separatisme 
weerstand tegen de Sovjetoverheersing en collaboratie met de binnenvallende Duitsers werden officieel als redenen aangevoerd 
Maar de ambitie om regio's etnisch te zuiveren was een onderliggende factor in het bijzonder 
in het geval van de Krimtataren De deportaties startten met Polen uit WitRusland Oekraïne en 
Europees Rusland in de periode Koreanen in het Russische Verre Oosten werden gedeporteerd in WolgaDuitsers 
en zeven overwegend Turkse of nietSlavische naties uit de Krim en de Noordelijke Kaukasus werden 
gedeporteerd de Krimtataren Kalmoeken Tsjetsjenen Ingoesjeten Balkaren Karatsjai en Meschetische Turken Andere minderheden die uit 
de regio rond de Zwarte Zeekust verwijderd werden waren de Bulgaren Grieken en Armeniërs Uit 
het net veroverde OostPolen werden personen gedeporteerd Hetzelfde gebeurde in de Baltische republieken Letland Litouwen 
en Estland meer dan Roemenen uit de oblast Tsjernivtsi en Moldavië werden in grote aantallen 
tussen de en gedeporteerd Volgens de laatste volkstelling in Rusland en Kazachstan leven er Roemenen 
in Kazachstan en in Rusland Grote aantallen gedeporteerden overleefden de operaties niet Geschat wordt dat 
van de Baltische gedeporteerden is overleden en bijna de helft van de Krimtataren door hongersnood 
in de eerste achttien maanden na hun verbanning overleed In totaal wordt geschat dat van 
alle gedeporteerden om het leven kwam Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog werd de hele bevolking van 
de Koningsbergen en omgeving vervangen door Russen Nikita Chroesjtsjov veroordeelde in zijn geheime rede in 
februari de deportaties als een schending van leninistische principes eraan toevoegend dat de Oekraïners hun 
noodlot alleen hadden kunnen ontkomen "doordat zij met te velen waren en er geen plaats 
was waarnaar hen te deporteren" Zijn regering draaide de meeste deportaties van Stalin terug hoewel 
het nog tot moest duren voor de Krimtataren Mescheten en WolgaDuitsers werd toegestaan om en 
masse terug te keren naar hun thuisland De deportaties hadden een diepgaande invloed op de 
nietRussische volkeren in de SovjetUnie en zijn nog steeds een belangrijk politiek thema De herinnering 
aan de deportaties speelt een grote rol in de separatistische bewegingen in Tatarije Tsjetsjenië en 
in de inmiddels onafhankelijke Baltische staten Het als straf verplaatsen van personen door de goelag 
en het systeem van onvrijwillige vestigingen in de SovjetUnie pasten in de plannen ter kolonisatie 
van afgelegen en onderbevolkte gebieden De grote schaal heeft tot de controversiële opvatting in het 
Westen geleid dat de economische groei in de SovjetUnie te danken was aan slavenarbeid door 
Goelaggevangenen Tegelijkertijd werd in enkele gevallen de migratie bewerkstelligd door nietgewelddadige methodes doorgaans door "rekrutering" 
вербовка verbovka Deze rekrutering werd doorgaans uitgevoerd in gedwongen nederzettingen waarvan de bevolking zich natuurlijk 
graag elders wilde hervestigen Bijvoorbeeld van de mankracht van de Donetsbekken en Koezbassmijngebieden is bekend 
dat die op deze manier werd aangevuld Ter vergelijking in tsaristisch Rusland werden staatskompels geworven

Het wapen van Oostzaan heeft twee versies gekend de laatste versie wordt tot op heden 
nog gebruikt als het wapen van de NoordHollandse gemeente Oostzaan Waar de elementen uit het 
huidige en vorige wapen vandaan komen is niet bekend De gemeente heeft in om een 
wijziging van het wapen gevraagd hierdoor zijn er twee blazoeneringen van het wapen van Oostzaan 
bekend De eerste blazoenering werd gegeven bij het wapen dat op juni aan de gemeente 
toegekend werd Het ging hierbij om de volgende blazoenering Het schild was van goud met 
daarop een zwarte drietand Op de punten van de drietand drie groene koeken Het tweede 
wapen werd op september met de volgende beschrijving toegekend Wederom was het schild goud van 
kleur echter nu met drie blauwe dwarsbalken Over het geheel heen wederom een drietand De 
groene koeken uit het vorige wapen zijn vervangen door groene rechthoeken Het wapen heeft nu 
ook een kroon van drie bladeren waartussen twee parels een gravenkroon In werd de heerlijkheid 
Oostzaan een vrije heerlijkheid sinds dat jaar heeft er dus geen familie klooster of kerk 
meer over Oostzaan geheerst Nadien heeft de heerlijkheid twee zegels gebruikt een met het eerste 
gemeentewapen en een gevierendeeld zegel met in het eerste en vierde kwartier een schip in 
aanbouw zoals ook in het wapen van Zaandam In vroeg de gemeente het huidige wapen 
aan de graszoden zouden beter bij de gemeente passen en de dwarsbalken werden op historische 
gronden aangevraagd Bij deze wijziging vroeg de gemeente in plaats van de kroon een helm 
met helmkleed aan Helmen komen in de Nederlandse heraldiek niet voor als overheidswapen en daarom 
werden de helm en helmkleed niet door de Hoge Raad van Adel verleend Het wapen 
van Soest toont wel een helm maar die is niet officieel door de Hoge Raad 
van Adel verleend is namelijk niet opgenomen in de blazoenering en Oostzaan kreeg wel de 
gebruikelijke gravenkroon aan de gemeente verleend Verschillende manuscripten en heraldici geven voor Oostzaan andere wapens 
dan dat er uiteindelijk verleend werden Over de herkomst van de greep drietand en de 
kazen en latere zoden bestaan twee verklaringen De zogenaamde kazen zijn eigenlijk kolen want in 
de omgeving worden veel kolen gekweekt en gegeten Bewoners van Oostzaan zouden ook de bijnaam 
Kooleters of Koolhanen hebben Gedurende de Tachtigjarige Oorlog zou een Oostzaanse vrijbuiter tijdens een overval 
op een bevoorradingsschip van de Spanjaarden in Amsterdam drie kazen aan zijn greep hebben geregen 
in plaats van een Spanjaard Deze gebeurtenis zou in het wapen van de heerlijkheid vastgelegd

creëren gebaseerd op samenwerking ethiek solidariteit en rechtvaardigheid in economische FairCoop ging op september van 
start na maanden van netwerken tussen verschillende mensen uit verscheidene gebieden omtrent alternatieve economieën Betrokken 
bij de start waren Enric Duran van de Catalan Integral Cooperative CIC Michael Bauwens van 
de Foundation en bitcoinontwikkelaar Amir De belangrijkste doelstelling van FairCoop is om een nieuwe samenleving 
mogelijk te maken waarbij de economische en sociale verschillen tussen mensen zoveel mogelijk verdwijnen In 
de vorm van commons wordt hiermee bijgedragen aan een nieuwe wereldwijde rijkdom voor alle Het 
overgaan naar een eerlijker monetair systeem is een belangrijk element voor het bereiken van de 
doelen van FairCoop Daarom ondersteunen ze FairCoin als cryptovaluta Eind april begon Enric Duran het 
idee uit te werken dat uiteindelijk leidde tot Na een uitgebreid onderzoek in de cryptovalutawereld 
koos hij De redenen hiervoor waren de geschiedenis van deze valuta en de mogelijkheid om 
het project anoniem te ontwikkelen Later openbaarde hij zijn identiteit en deelde hij zijn plan 
met de andere leden van het ontwikkelteam om samen te werken voor In mei juni 
en juli deelde Duran het project met verschillende partners van het CIC en de Foundation 
zoals Michel Bauwens en Stacco Troncoso Ook deelde hij het project met ontwikkelaars van Dark 
zoals Amir Taaki en Paul Martin en met diverse andere mensen en initiatieven wereldwijd Daardoor 
werd het mogelijk FairCoop op september te FairCoop is een open coöperatieef gebaseerd op de 
volgende vier belangrijkste elementen opgesteld door Michel FairCoop combineert de voordelen van nieuwe gedecentraliseerde technologieën 
met ethische principes en ervaringen van activisten en groepen die een nieuw economisch systeem proberen 
te creëren gebaseerd op samenwerking en economische rechtvaardigheid De coöperatie biedt financiële hulp en diensten 
voor het creëren en verspreiden van gratis gemeenschappelijke Op lange termijn streeft FairCoop naar het 
maken van een omgeving om een nieuw sociaal en economisch systeem op te bouwen gebaseerd 
op gedecentraliseerde samenwerking wat er voor zal zorgen dat natiestaten en centrale banken niet meer 
per se nodig zijn Op korte termijn streeft FairCoop naar het creëren van ruimte voor 
echte samenwerking met projecten overal ter wereld voor de mensheid als Een van de belangrijkste 
doelstellingen van de FairCoop is het creëren van een nieuw mondiaal economisch systeem gebaseerd op

Rapaxavis pani is een vogel behorend tot de Enantiornithes die tijdens het vroege Krijt leefde 
in het gebied van het huidige China In meldde Eric Morschhauser de vondst door Pan 
Lijun van een vogelexemplaar bij Xiaioyugou nabij de stad Lianhe in Liaoning Hij wees dit 
toe aan Longirostravis In vond een cladistische analyse echter enige anatomische verschillen die erop duidden 
dat het om een apart taxon ging In benoemden en beschreven EM Morschhauser David Varricchio 
Gao Chunling Liu Jinyuan Wang Xuri Cheng Xiadong en Meng Qingjin de typesoort Rapaxavis pani 
De geslachtsnaam is een combinatie van het Latijn rapax "roofzuchtig" en avis "vogel" een verwijzing 
naar de grijpende bouw van de voet De soortaanduiding eert Pan als ontdekker Tevens is 
het een toespeling op Pan de god der wouden gezien een vermoedde levenswijze als boombewoner 
Het holotype DMNH is gevonden in een laag van de Jiufotangformatie die dateert uit het 
vroege Albien Het bestaat uit een skelet met schedel op een plaat en tegenplaat Bij 
de splijting bleven de botten fraai op de hoofdplaat zitten zonder mee te splijten zodat 
hun botwanden gaaf bewaard bleven Ze werden in beschreven zonder enige preparatie Een gedeelte van 
de ruggengraat wordt echter bedekt door het borstbeen Het betreft een jongvolwassen exemplaar Na de 
oorspronkelijke beschrijving werd het stuk alsnog maar onoordeelkundig geprepareerd "door een amateur" Dat leidde tot 
beschadigingen; zo gingen het rechterjukbeen en de helft van de takken van het vorkbeen verloren 
Het werd daarop naar het Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County gezonden voor een 
professionele behandeling waarbij wat van de schade hersteld kon worden In werd de anatomie meer 
in detail beschreven op basis van kenmerken die nu zichtbaar gemaakt waren Het holotype van 
Rapaxavis is een vrij kleine vogel Het gewicht ervan is geschat op zevenenveertig gram In 
werden enkele onderscheidende kenmerken vastgesteld die ook naar huidige maatstaven geldig zijn Het heiligbeen heeft 
zes sacrale wervels Bij het borstbeen hebben de buitenste achterste uitsteeksels twee hoofdtakken en een 
derde kleinere tak Het borstbeen heeft aan de voorste buitenhoeken extra verbeningen met een driehoekig 
profiel De herbeschrijving uit voegde hieraan een aantal kenmerken toe De snuit beslaat van de 
schedellengte De tanden bevinden zich alleen in de voorste gedeelten van de kaken De voorste 
tak van het bovenkaaksbeen richting praemaxilla is ongeveer driemaal langer dan de achterste tak naar 
het jukbeen Het neusbeen heeft geen neergaande tak richting bovenkaaksbeen Er bevindt zich een spleetvormige 
inkeping in de achterrand van de benige neusgaten Het vorkbeen heeft vooraan een korte symfyse 
en de takken maken een hoek van met elkaar Het ravenbeksbeen heeft een rechte in 
plaats van bolle buitenrand en een recht raakvlak met het borstbeen De gepaarde facetten op 
het borstbeen voor de ravenbeksbeenderen beschrijven een stompe hoek van zo'n Het dijbeen heeft vier 
vijfden van de lengte van het onderbeen De voorlaatste teenkootjes zijn langer dan de bovenliggende 
kootjes Het kenmerk van de derde tak bij de buitenste achterste uitsteeksels van het borstbeen 
bleek te berusten op een foute identificatie van een ribfragment De snuit van Rapaxavis is 
erg lang en licht naar beneden gebogen De praemaxilla heeft minstens drie maar vermoedelijk vier 
kleine tanden die naar achteren in grootte afnemen In het bovenkaaksbeen zijn geen tanden gevonden 
De onderkaken hebben maar een klein aantal tanden; twee in het voorste dentarium Een dun 
tongbeen is aangetroffen Er zijn negen of tien halswervels en zes vrije staartwervels vóór het 
pygostyle Het grote pygostyle is ingesnoerd en loopt naar achteren taps uit Het achterste uitsteeksel 
van het borstbeen op de middenlijn is niet verbreed De extra verbeningen hebben een poreuze 
structuur Ze werden in "paracoracoidales" genoemd omdat ze nog buiten de ravenbeksbeenderen liggen en daardoor 
ten dele overlapt worden Hun functie is onduidelijk; soortgelijke maar minder uitgebreide structuren toont Concornis 
De ellepijp is robuust bijna even dik als het opperarmbeen Het spaakbeen is half zo 
dik De pols omvat alleen een hartvormig ulnare De middenhand is niet vergroeid De vingers 
zijn opvallend gereduceerd De eerste en tweede vingers hebben geen klauwen Het eerste kootje van 
de tweede vinger is cilindervormig; het tweede kootje eindigt taps en de achterzijde ervan vormt 
een scherpe richel Het tweede kootje van de derde vinger is sterk gereduceerd tot weinig 
meer dan een beensplinter De formule van de vingerkootjes is Morschhauser beschreef het zitbeen als 
sikkelvormig maar in concludeerde men dat het eerder bandvormig was met alleen een opwaartse curve 
over het onderste derde deel Het schaambeen eindigt in een kleine "voet" De achterpoot is 
langer dan de voorpoot Het dijbeen is licht gebogen Het scheenbeen is niet met de 
enkel vergroeid tot een tabiotarsus Over het onderste vijfde deel van het voorste scheenbeen is 
er een ondiepe groeve wellicht het retinaculum extensori dat de voet strekkende pees bergt Sprongbeen 
en hielbeen zijn wel met elkaar vergroeid Er zijn ook twee vrije zij het met 
elkaar vergroeide onderste enkelbeenderen zodat er ook geen tarsometatarsus is De onderst enkelbeenderen vormen een 
volle kap boven het tweede tot en met vierde middenvoetsbeen Dit weerlegt de hypothese dat 
er een Sauriurae zou bestaan die zich zou onderscheiden van vermeende nietdinosaurische "echte" vogels door 
kleine onderste enkelbeenderen De middenvoet is volgens Morschhauser alleen bovenaan vergroeid; volgens de beschrijving uit 
zelfs daar niet Dit kan samenhangen met een jonge individuele leeftijd Anders dan in gesteld 
is het eerste middenvoetsbeen niet Jvormig maar recht De eerste teen is lang Het voorlaatste 
kootje van de derde teen is anderhalf maal langer dan het tweede kootje; het vierde 
kootje van de vierde teen zelfs tweemaal langer dan het vierde kootje Dat maakt het 
eenvoudiger een tak te omklemmen De formule van de teenkootjes is De voetklauwen zijn groot 
en sterk gekromd min of meer haakvormig Hun lengte inclusief hoornschachten werd geschat op tot 
van de teenlengte In het beschrijvende artikel van werd Rapaxavis binnen de Enantiornithes in de 
Euenantiornithes geplaatst Al eerder in was dat voor DMNH verder verfijnd tot de Longipterygidae Het 
volgende kladogram toont een mogelijke positie van Rapaxavis in de evolutionaire stamboom Protopteryx Elsornis Iberomesornis 
Boluochia Longipteryx Shanweiniao Longirostravis Rapaxavis IVPP V Pengornis Eocathayornis Cathayornis Neuquenornis Gobipteryx Vescornis Eoalulavis Concornis 
Qiliania Eoenantiornis Shenqiornis Sulcavis Zhouornis Longusunguis Parabohaiornis Bohaiornis Voor de verwant Longirostravis die een vergelijkbaar 
lange snuit heeft werd een levenswijze aangenomen van het zoeken van wormen in de modder 
Bij Rapaxavis vielen de grote voeten met een oponeerbare lange eerste teen en voorlaatste teenkootjes 
dermate op dat men in ook de mogelijkheid overwoog dat het dier in bomen klom

is men het niet eens het zou ofwel wacht houden ofwel waadplaats kunnen betekenen De 
Romeinse heerweg vanuit Antwerpen splitste zich te Wachtebeke in de richting van Gent en de 
richting van Brugge Vanaf de eeuw waren het vooral de omliggende abdijen die grond in 
bezit hadden in Wachtebeke De turfwinning ontstond en omdat deze winning zeer arbeidsintensief was trokken 
vele mensen naar de streek om er te gaan wonen Voor de afvoer van de 
turf naar Gent werd in de late middeleeuwen de Langelede gegraven Deze waterloop werd in 
grondig vernieuwd Wachtebeke is nooit een zelfstandige heerlijkheid geweest Het heeft steeds deel uitgemaakt van 
het ambacht Assenede en behoort dus tot het Meetjesland De parochies Wachtebeke en SintKruisWinkel vormden

ten noorden van Venlo aan de rivier de Maas Tot behoorde het dorp tot de 
gemeente Grubbenvorst maar deze is in opgegaan in de gemeente Horst aan de Maas Lottum 
heeft pas na een eigen schepenbank gekregen nadat het in tot een vrije baronie werd 
verheven door aartshertog Albrecht De eerste akte met het wapen is uit en vertoont de 
Heilige Quirinus als ridder met in de rechterhand een lans Links van hem staat de 
kerkpatrones de Heilige Gertrudis van Nijvel die in haar linkerhand een kromstaf houdt waarlangs een 
muis ophoog klimt Voor hem staat een wapenschild beladen met negen koeken zijnde de attributen 
van hem Dit wapen wijst op het bezit van het Quirinuskapittel van Neuss te Lottum 
Het gebied waar Lottum ligt was al bewoond gedurende de Romeinse tijd Omstreeks werd de 
kerk gebouwd Het gebied was tot in bezit van de SintQuirinusabdij een benedictinessenabdij te Neuss 
Daarna werd het door de abdij uitgegeven aan Christoffel van Wylick en het bleef in 
die familie In werd zijn opvolger Johan Christoffel van Wylick door koning Filips III van 
Spanje tot baron verheven In werd Lottum onderdeel van Spaans Gelre en in van Pruisen 
In werd het bij Nederland gevoegd en dit bleef ook na de Belgische afscheiding zo 
Omstreeks werd de rozenteelt in Lottum geïntroduceerd en deze teelt nam zo'n hoge vlucht dat 
op een gegeven ogenblik ongeveer deel van de inwoners in de rozenteelt werkzaam was Sinds 
werd het tweejaarlijkse Rozenfestival georganiseerd Ook tegenwoordig is de rozenteelt een belangrijke activiteit Zie ook 
Lottum is gelegen op de westoever van de Maas op een hoogte van ongeveer meter 
boven NAP Vanaf het natuurgebied Schuitwater stroomt de Siebersbeek via Lottum in de Maas De 
omgeving van Lottum wordt vooral gekenmerkt door siertuinbouw namelijk rozenteelt In het zuidwesten vindt men 
heideontginningen Nabij de buurtschap Houthuizen loopt de Molenbeek welke enkele honderden meter daarna uitmondt in 
de Maas In de nabijheid van de mondingen van beide beken ligt natuurgebied Siebersbeek Ten 
zuiden daarvan ligt natuurgebied Kaldenbroek Lottum is vooral bekend om zijn rozenteelt Ruim procent van 
de rozenteelt in Nederland is afkomstig uit Lottum; dit komt neer op miljoen rozenbron Hierdoor 
wordt Lottum ook wel het "Rozendorp van Nederland" genoemd Om de twee jaar in de 
even jaren vindt in Lottum rond de tweede zondag van augustus het Rozenfestival plaats Tijdens 
dit festival zijn tuinen mozaïeken en objecten verspreid over heel Lottum versierd met ontelbare rozenknopjes 
Er komen ongeveer bezoekers per keer naar dit festival In Lottum bevindt zich ook De

Gerardo "Gerry" de Leon Manilla september – juli was een Filipijns filmregisseur De Leon is 
de meest onderscheiden filmregisseur uit de geschiedenis van de Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and 
Sciences en werd een jaar na zijn dood in uitgeroepen tot nationaal kunstenaar van de 
Filipijnen Gerry de Leon werd geboren als Gerardo Ilagan op september en groeide op in 
het district Sampaloc in Manilla Zijn vader Hermogenes Ilagan was schrijver en producent van zarzuelas 
een populaire vorm van opera in de Filipijnen aan het begin van de eeuw Met 
zijn bedrijf "Compania Ilagan" trok hij van plaats tot plaats om voorstellingen te geven op 
lokale festivals en feesten in de omgeving van Manilla Gerry kwam hierdoor al van jongs 
af aan in aanraking met de Filipijnse amusementsindustrie De in opkomst zijnde filmindustrie had echter 
meer Gerry's interesse Hij bracht veel tijd door in twee kleine filmhuizen op Tuazon Street 
bij hem in de buurt Zijn eerste bijbaantje tijdens zijn middelbareschooltijd aan het oude Jose 
Rizal College in Quiapo was pianospelen in het Cine Moderno tijdens de daar getoonde Amerikaanse 
en Europese stomme films Na het voltooien van zijn middelbareschoolopleiding studeerde hij medicijnen aan de 
University of Santo Tomas Na enige jaren fulltime studeren trok de filmindustrie opnieuw Hij werd 
beroepsacteur en scenarioschrijver Desondanks wist hij zijn studie succesvol af te ronden en slaagde hij 
bovendien voor het toelatingsexamen als dokter Hij werkte enige tijd als arts maar stopte daarmee 
omdat hij naar eigen zeggen "te weinig afstand kon houden tot de patiënten" In kreeg 
hij van producent Pilar Hidalgo Lim de kans om de film 'Ama't Anak' te regisseren 
Hij speelde bovendien zelf als acteur mee in deze film net als zijn broer Tito 
Arevalo De film werd goed ontvangen en hij kreeg daarop al snel nieuwe opdrachten Gerardo 
besloot al vroeg in zijn carrière als regisseur om de achternaam van zijn moeder te 
gebruiken als artiestennaam vanwege mogelijke verwarring met de vele familieleden uit de Iliganfamilie die in 
de theater en filmindustrie werkten Hij regisseerde filsm voor LVN Sampaguita en RDR productions Zijn 
grootste vooroorlogse succes was de film 'Ang Maestra' De film waarvan het scenario geschreven werd 
door Eddie Romero met in de hoofdrollen Roselio de la Rosa en Rosa del Rosario 
werd een kaskraker Een andere film uit deze periode was de historische film 'Diego Silang' 
over de rebellenleider Diego Silang Al deze films uit zijn vooroorlogse periode zijn verloren gegaan 
door het kwetsbare materiaal dat gebruikt werd De bezetting van de Filipijnen door de Japanners 
in bracht de Filipijnse filmindustrie abrupt tot stilstand De Leon ging daarop toneelstukken regisseren in 
het Life Theater en begon daarnaast weer te werken als arts Niet lang voor het 
einde van de oorlog in de Filipijnen kreeg De Leon het verzoek van de Japanners 
om mee te werken aan een film Samen met de Japanner Yutaka Abe regisseerde hij 
de propagandafilms 'Tear Down the American Flag' en 'The Dawn of Freedom' Na de oorlog 
kwam de Filipijnse filmindustrie weer op gang Met De Leons carrière als regisseur ging het 
eveneens voorspoedig Voor zijn films kreeg hij veel FAMAS Awards de Filipijnse variant van de 
Oscar Zo won hij tussen en zeven maal een FAMAS Award voor beste regisseur Bovendien 
wonnen al deze films tevens de FAMAS Award voor beste film Veel van zijn films 
uit de jaren en werden Filipijnse filmklassiekers Voorbeelden daarvan zijn 'Sisa' 'Noli me tangere' 'El

DragonFly BSD is een besturingssysteem voor diverse computerplatformen Het is een fork van FreeBSD Omdat 
voormalig FreeBSD en Amigaontwikkelaar Matthew Dillon het niet eens was met de ingeslagen koers voor 
versie vijf besloot hij in om samen met anderen zelfstandig verder te gaan Ze gebruikten 
versie van FreeBSD als basis voor de ontwikkeling voor DragonFly BSD De voornaamste reden voor 
de afsplitsing was dat Dillon dacht dat de thread en SMPtechnieken in versie vijf van 
FreeBSD niet efficiënt genoeg waren en dat dit zou resulteren in lagere systeemprestaties In eerste 
instantie probeerde hij zelf de voorziene problemen in FreeBSD op te lossen maar dat leidde 
tot conflicten met andere ontwikkelaars Hierdoor werd zijn recht om direct het codearchief te bewerken 
ingetrokken Ondanks dit conflict werken beide partijen nu nog steeds samen om problemen op te 
lossen in de gemeenschappelijke code en worden algemene verbeteringen uitgewisseld In versie werd het pkgsrc 
het pakketbeheersysteem uit NetBSD het officiële standaard pakketbeheersysteem Versie introduceerde de virtuele kernel In versie 
werd de eerste versie van DragonFly Mail Agent geïntroduceerd in de baseinstallatie om in de 
toekomst Sendmail te vervangen Ook werd de ondersteuning voor de Intel officieel gestaakt Sinds versie

Merce Cunningham Centralia april – New York juli was een Amerikaanse choreograaf die van grote 
invloed was op de moderne dans van de eeuw Cunningham werd geboren als zoon van 
een advocaat Hij had twee broers die zijn vader opvolgde in het rechten leven Als 
leerde hij tapdansen Van tot studeerde hij dans en theater aan de Cornish School in 
Seattle Vanaf tot danste hij solo in het dansgezelschap van Martha Graham Hij ontwierp zijn 
eerste choreografie in in New York met John Cage als pianist In zag zijn Merce 
Cunningham Dance Company het levenslicht Tot op heden voerde het gezelschap een choreografieën op Door 
zijn werk als choreograaf en danser stond Cunningham meer dan jaar op het voorplan in 
deze discipline Hij had een sterke invloed op andere kunstuitingen en kunstenaars zoals de musici 
John Cage en David Tudor de beeldende kunstenaars Robert Rauschenberg en Bruce Nauman designer Romeo 
Gigli en architect Benedetta Tagliabue Als docent en hoofd van de Merce Cunningham Dance Company 
vernieuwde hij in de jaren vijftig alle gangbare codes van het toenmalige beschrijvende ballet Als 
choreograaf verliet hij de verhaallijn en de logische opbouw Hij liet zijn dansers geen verhaal 
vertellen op muziek met een aangepast decor maar liet de choreografie het verhaal vertellen Daarbij 
introduceerde hij het toeval in de dans met aleatorische muziek van Cage Terwijl hij aan 
het Black Mountain College was verbonden ontstond in de ondertussen legendarische happening met Cage en 
Rauschenberg Ook Jasper Johns Charles Atlas en William Anastani leverden hun creatieve bijdrage Langzamerhand kregen 
Cunninghams opvattingen meer invloed in de danswereld Elke beweging kon gaandeweg als dans aanzien worden 
in de postmoderne optiek Kenmerkend voor Cunninghams choreografie was een beweginsstijl vol plotse wendingen minieme 
sprongetjes rompdraaiingen en langzame evenwichtsverplaatsingen gevat in verrassende ruimtelijke patronen Daarbij liet de choreograaf zich 
inspireren door het gewriemel van mensen in de New Yorkse straten Ook de observatie van 
de natuur en de beweging van vogels bracht inspiratie zoals bij creaties als Winterbranch Beach 
Birds en Ocean In de jaren negentig van de twintigste eeuw betrok Cunningham de pc 
als compositorisch hulpmiddel bij zijn creaties als Biped In gaf hij met de creatie van 
EyeSpace de toeschouwers de kans zelf muziek te kiezen via de iPod In april vierde 
de choreograaf zijn negentigste verjaardag met de première van een nieuw werk Nearly Ninety aan 
de Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in samenwerking met de musici John Paul 
Jones exbassist van Led Zeppelin Sonic Youth en Takehisa Kosugi De choreograaf ontving vele hoge 
onderscheidingen zoals de National Medal of Arts en de MacArthur Fellowship Hij werd ook gehuldigd 
met de Japanse Praemium Imperiale de Britse Laurence Olivier Award en was Officier in het 
Franse Legioen van Eer Cunninghams kunstzinnige visie op dans en beweging was het onderwerp van 
vele publicaties films en tentoonstellingen Zijn choreografieën werden uitgevoerd door belangrijke balletgroepen zoals het Ballet 
van de Parijse Opera het New York City Ballet het American Ballet Theatre het White 
Oak Dance Project en de Londense Rambert Dance Company De choreograaf riep de The Merce 
Cunningham Trust in het leven om zijn totale oeuvre te bewaren na zijn dood Daarbij 
stelde hij dat zijn dansgezelschap nog twee jaar zou optreden en vervolgens zichzelf zou ontbinden 
Daarna zouden de dansers een financiële vergoeding krijgen van deze trust In kondigde Cunningham de 
Cunningham Dance Foundation aan met een voorstel tot voortzetting van het werk van Cunningham teneinde 
zijn artistieke erfenis veilig te stellen Deze stichting beheert ook de rechten op de producties 
Zij zal ook de creaties in detail laten vastleggen zodat deze nadien precies door anderen 
kunnen uitgevoerd worden De stichting zal ook Cunninghams kunstverzameling bestaande uit decors van Jasper Johns 
en Robert Rauschenberg beheren Vele dansers die dansten in zijn gezelschap vormden later hun eigen 
dansgroepen zoals Paul Taylor Trisha Brown Lucinda Childs Karole Armitage Foofwa d’Immobilité en Jonah Bokaer 
Ook Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker maakte tijdens haar dansopleiding te New York kennis met Cunninghams 
vernieuwende danstaal die zij als een verrijking ervoer Desgevraagd zei ze in dit verband "Doorheen 
een dansopleiding word je geconfronteerd met de traditie en van daar uit moet je je 
eigen taal ontwikkelen Het is moeilijk om aan te geven op welke manier Cunningham me 
in mijn werk heeft beïnvloed Het staat wel vast dat zijn radicale statement tegen het

Van de Carnaval zijn twee generaties uitgebracht De eerste generatie Carnival geïntroduceerd in had een 
liter die pk leverde De auto was uitgerust met een automatische vijfversnellingsbak en was in 
vergelijking met zijn concurrenten wat spartaans uitgevoerd; zo had de auto geen navigatiesysteem achteruitkijkcamera ed

In Boedapest is het Zoltán Kodályherdenkingsmuseum aan zijn werk en leven gewijd Kodály werd geboren 
in Kecskemét maar bracht het grootste deel van zijn jeugd door in Galánta nu Galanta 
en Nagyszombat nu Trnava Zijn vader was een begaafd amateurmusicus die zijn zoon vioolles gaf 
Zijn vader zong ook in een kerkkoor en schreef muziek zonder daarvoor een opleiding gehad 
te hebben Zijn moeder was pianiste; Kodály groeide dus op in een muzikaal milieu Zijn 
eerste orkestwerkjes werden opgevoerd in zijn school Na het gymnasium ging hij naar de Universiteit 
van Boedapest en de Franz Liszt Muziekacademie Daar studeerde hij onder Hans Koessler die ook 
de leraar was van Bartók en Dohnányi Na zijn afstuderen in ontmoette hij Bartók Onder 
diens invloed ging hij volksmuziek verzamelen in Galanta in de Trnava regio wat hij bleef 
doen tot De Eerste Wereldoorlog maakte hem dit werk feitelijk onmogelijk Ook al hechtte hij 
groot belang aan de volksmuziek hij had ook grote interesse in andere muziek waarvoor hij 
naar Bayreuth Salzburg Berlijn en Parijs reisde Hij werd in leraar muziektheorie aan de Franz 
Liszt Muziekacademie en nam in de compositieklas van Koessler over wat hij deed tot In

publiceren Na het vertrek van Bartók naar Amerika zette Kodály het werk eraan voort Het 
eerste deel verscheen in In ging Kodály met pensioen Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog reisde hij 
naar Engeland Frankrijk Amerika en de USSR om zijn eigen composities te dirigeren Kodály's inspanningen 
op het gebied van de muziekpedagogiek leidden tot de invoering van een op zijn werk 
gebaseerde muziekmethode in het Hongaars lager onderwijs Deze methode ligt ook aan de basis van 
het hoge niveau dat Hongaarse koren sindsdien hebben bereikt De Nederlandse componist en muziekpedagoog Pierre 
van Hauwe ontwikkelde de belangrijkste uitgangspunten van de Kodálymethode de solfège en de muzieknotatie in

gaat De zelf eindigt bij de rotonde in Glis De autosnelweg is een belangrijke verbinding 
tussen Lausanne en Italië Ook vormt de weg een alternatieve route om de Gotthardtunnel te 
vermijden De autosnelweg loopt vanaf het beginpunt bij de grens met Frankrijk tot en met 
Sierre door het Franstalige gedeelte van Zwitserland Voorbij Sierre loopt de autosnelweg door het Duitstalige 
gedeelte van Zwitserland Alle borden op de autosnelweg zijn aangepast op de taal die er 
gesproken wordt Het tracé tussen VispOost en BrigGlis is een recent opgeleverd stuk autosnelweg dat 
onderdeel uitmaakt van het project SierreBrig Het tracé tussen SierreOost en VispOost bevindt zich nog 
in de voorbereidingsfase Het project zal ongeveer miljard CHF circa miljard euro gaan kosten Het 
nieuwe stuk autosnelweg is met name bedoeld om de doorstroming van het doorgaande verkeer te 
verbeteren aangezien de bestaande verbindingen al van een behoorlijke kwaliteit zijn De route over de 
Simplonpas wordt niet uitgebouwd tot autosnelweg Zij maakt onderdeel uit van de Hauptstrasse en is 
in verhouding tot andere bergpassen ruim aangelegd Op maart gebeurde in de Sierretunnel nabij Sierre 
Elia is de transmissienetbeheerder van het Belgische hoogspanningsnet en staat in voor de transmissie van 
elektriciteit Elia stelt als netbeheerder het transportnet beschikbaar voor elektriciteitstransporten en waarborgt de balans tussen 
vraag en aanbod Elia Group is een beursgenoteerd bedrijf met vrij verhandelbare aandelen en maakt 
sinds maart deel uit van de BEL De grootaandeelhouders zijn de gemeentelijke holdings PubliT en 
Publipart de Brusselse intercommunale Interfin en staatsbedrijf Belfius Insurance Sinds oktober is Katoen Natie de 
grootste Bij de wet geregeld is Elia een monopolist; zij beheert als enige het Belgische 
net van kV en hoger Voor de vaststelling van de tarieven heeft de overheid de 
CREG als toezichthouder aangewezen Er is overleg tussen beide partijen maar het is de toezichthouder 
die beslist over de tarieven die Elia haar klanten mag aanrekenen De tegenhanger voor gastransport 
is Fluxys Over het hoogspanningsnet wordt stroom vervoerd van de producenten naar de distributienetbeheerders en 
de industriële grootverbruikers Elia bezit het gehele Belgische netinfrastructuur van tot kV en nagenoeg van 
de netinfrastructuur van tot kV Elia heeft de ambitie de resterende van het tot kV 
aan te kopen Het net heeft een totale lengte van ongeveer kilometer waarvan kilometer ondergrondse 
verbindingen Het hoofdkantoor van Elia is gevestigd in Brussel Elia heeft ruim medewerkers Het net 
van Elia is een essentiële verbinding tussen Frankrijk traditioneel de grootste exporteur van elektriciteit in 
Europa en de NoordEuropese markten In heeft België per saldo meer elektriciteit uitgevoerd dan ingevoerd; 
de netto uitvoer was terawattuur TWh Het jaar ervoor werd nog netto voor TWh ingevoerd 
De belangrijkste handelspartner voor elektriciteit is Frankrijk De kernactiviteiten van Elia zijn België heeft goede 
internationale netwerkverbindingen met Frankrijk Nederland en Luxemburg Per begin studeert Elia aan drie nieuwe internationale 
verbindingen namelijk Elia tekende in ook een consultant contract met de Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection 
Authority een samenwerkingsverband van landen gelegen aan de Perzische Golf De partners van Elia zijn 
Tractebel Engineering en de Franse netbeheerder RTE Op maart werd bekendgegeven dat Elia en het 
Australische infrastructuurfonds IFM een overeenkomst met Vattenfall hadden bereikt over de overname van de Duitse 
netbeheerder beheert het transmissienet in de voormalige DDR en in de regio Hamburg Voor de 
overname betaalden Elia en IFM een bedrag van miljoen euro De verkoop werd op mei 
Elia heeft sindsdien procent van in handen en oefent ook de operationele controle uit IFM 
bezit van Er werken ongeveer mensen bij het hoogspanningsnetwerk bestaat uit kilometer lijnen en kilometer 
lijnen Op april maakten de Belgische energiebeurs Belpex en APXENDEX bekend te willen fuseren Elia 
en TenneT zullen hun aandeel in Belpex voor Elia en voor TenneT overdragen aan APXENDEX 
Elia zal een belang van in de vergrote APXENDEX verkrijgen waarvan TenneT de grootste aandeelhouder 
is Door deze transactie komt het streven naar één NoordwestEuropese elektriciteitsmarkt In hebben netbeheerders uit 
Europa afgesproken de samenwerking te intensiveren Een nieuwe organisatie is opgericht met de naam ENTSOE

In de elektrostatica betekent polarisatie het ontstaan van een elektrisch veld ten gevolge van een 
potentiaalverschil De diëlektrische constante ε van een diëlektrisch materiaal diëlektricum bijvoorbeeld een nietgeleidende vloeistof zoals 
alcohol kan bepaald worden door het materiaal tussen de platen van een condensator te brengen 
en een potentiaal aan te leggen De polarisatie van het materiaal kan berekend worden uit 
de ClausiusMosottivergelijking P is de molaire polarisatie M de molaire massa en ρ de dichtheid 
In het algemeen bestaat de polarisatie uit twee componenten De moleculen in de vloeistof kunnen 
permanente dipolen met dipoolmoment μ bevatten die zich zullen oriënteren onder invloed van het aangelegde 
veld Anderszins kan het veld ook tijdelijke dipolen D in het molecuul veroorzaken door inductie 
De twee bijdragen hebben een verschillend temperatuurgedrag Hoe hoger de temperatuur hoe meer de moleculen 
in beweging zijn en hoe moeilijker het is de permanente dipolen uit te richten met 
een veld Volgens Peter Debye is de permanente bijdrage De geïnduceerde bijdrage hangt af van 
de polariseerbaarheid α van het molecuul μ en α zijn eigenschappen van het molecuul en 
zijn vrijwel onafhankelijk van de temperatuur Slechts bij voldoende hoge temperaturen waarbij elektronische overgangen in 
het molecuul van belang gaan worden verandert dit Men kan daarom de polarisatie P als 
functie van de reciproque temperatuur meten en dan de twee bijdragen scheiden Uit de helling

Firtel is een evenement dat elk jaar op de zondag van oktober doorgaat in de 
Belgische plaats Zulte Het evenement bestaat uit een autopubliciteitskaravaan verschillende dans en muziekgroepen Zultse Reuzen 
en praalwagens waarop korte toneelstukjes worden uitgevoerd op verschillende plaatsen langs een vooraf uitgestippeld traject 
Het is niet geweten wanneer de firtel exact is ontstaan Uit inlichtingen die destijds door 
erenotaris PieterHendrik Martens werden verstrekt weten we dat er vóór al fietelliedjes werden geschreven voor 
de stoet Het fietellied werd toen gewoonlijk geschreven door de verdienstelijke rederrijkersdichter uit Wakken PeterJoost 
de Borchgraeve De stoet had geen religieuze oorsprong Vanaf de jaren werd er geen stoet 
meer georganiseerd door de felle armoede die heerste in Zulte Het terugkeren van de stoet 
gebeurde maar in In werd de fietelstoet 'geherintroduceerd' door Zultenaars Clemens Verplaetse Jan Standaert en 
Leo Lefever Deze drie heren gingen op de dinsdag na de traditionele tweedaagse kermis verkleed 
een aantal herbergen bezoeken Dit deden ze al zingend en springend doorheen het dorp Aangemoedigd 
door de bijval gingen ze zich vertonen op het kasteel van Zulte waar ze van 
baron Limnander een kan bier en een dubbele frank drinkgeld kregen Hoewel er dus zeker 
voorlopers geweest zijn is het die editie die vandaag de dag beschouwd wordt als de 
definitieve start van de Firteltraditie Het volgende jaar werd besloten meer te doen en zo 
gebeurde het ook de fietel was herboren Onder impuls van enkele nieuwe fietelmannen werd in 
een 'stoet met talrijke verbeteringen' voorgesteld De heropleving was een feit en in waren er 
deelnemende fietelwagens In die periode werd ook beslist de stoet op dinsdagnamiddag te laten doorgaan 
Vanaf werd er ook vuurwerk afgeschoten In het jaar ging de laatste vooroorlogse fietel door 
Na de eerste wereldoorlog dook de Firtelstoet opnieuw op Vanaf nu werd het ook Firtel 
genoemd om welke reden dan ook De stoet ging nu definitief uit op dinsdagnamiddag en 
's avonds volgde de fakkeltocht Onder impuls van Nestor en Gaston Martens ging de stoet 
enkele succesvolle jaren tegemoet tussen beide oorlogen In ging de firtel voor de laatste keer 
door voor de tweede wereldoorlog De stoet trok zich in traag terug op gang Het 
was een schuchtere start met slechts praalwagens Vanaf zat er nieuw leven in want toen 
melden zich liefst groepen aan In de jaren zat de firtel in een bloeiende periode 
In schreef De Gentenaar dat de jongste uitgave schitterend geslaagd is Een zee van volk 
een cristalisatie van suggestieve uitbeeldingen Het verloop getuigde van organisatiegeest en mocht terecht bogen op 
de algemene bewondering van duizenden toeschouwers In werd de honderdste verjaardag van de firtel gevierd 
Toen werd er speciaal eeen firtelbok gemaakt en is sindsdien het symbool van de stoet 
Ook brouwde AngloBelge speciaal voor de gelegenheid een 'firtelbok'biertje De viering van deze firtel werd 
ingezet op zaterdagavond met het proces en de verbranding van de oude reuzen en de 
inhuldiging en huwelijk van de nieuwe De dag erop zondag oktober ging de stoet voor 
het eerst in zijn geschiedenis door op een zondag De belangstelling was enorm want duizenden 
toeschouwers waren van overal naar Zulte afgezakt De pers was eveneens talrijk aanwezig en op 
diezelfde avond was er een filmverslag op de Vlaamse Televisie praalwagens namen deel aan de 
editie een nieuw record dat zelfs tot op de dag van vandaag niet werd gebroken 
Op dinsdagavond werd de feesteditie afgesloten met de traditionele fakkeltocht In en probeerden ze de 
stoet terug op een dinsdag te laten doorgaan maar vanaf werd definitief gekozen voor de 
eerste zondag van oktober Deze wisseling van datum betekende echter ook het stille einde van 
de tradionele fakkeltocht die op dinsdagavond doorging Het aantal deelnemers slonk jaar na jaar en 
in ging de laatste fakkeltocht uit Na nog enkele succesvolle firteledities kende de stoet een 
nieuw dieptepunt in met slechts vier deelnemende praalwagens De stoet werd stilaan uitgebreid met showkorpsen 
en dansgroepen uit Zulte en omstreken In de jaren werd werk gemaakt van een heropleving 
van de firtel Talrijke nieuwe initiatieven werden er in en rond de stoet georganiseerd sommige 
succesvol andere een kort leven beschoren De firtelstoet zelf kende van tot een heropleving met 
meer dan deelnemende praalwagens De opleving was echter weer van korte duur want in titelde 
het Nieuwsblad firtel in krisis De firtel krabbelde met enkele kleine heroplevingen door tot het 
jaar wat tot nu toe het dieptepunt is van alle firtels met slechts drie praalwagens 
Vanaf is het aantal deelnemers weer positief toegenomen met meer dan tien firtelwagens in het 
jaar en Ook de magische verjaardag in werd er één om nooit te vergeten De 
week voor de firtel werd een standbeeld van twee dansende firtelbokken onthuld op het kerkplein 
van Zulte Dit beeld werd geschonken door de Vriendenkring van Zulte en werd ontworpen door 
de bezieler van de Gentse Feesten Walter de Buck Tijdens dit jaar werden talrijke activiteiten 
op touw gezet om de jaargang te vieren Het aantal wagens blijft stabiel op een 
en de publiciteitskaravaan die sinds een aantal jaren de stoet vooraf gaat trekt ieder jaar 
meer en meer deelnemers De firtelstoet bestaat uit tientallen deelnemers en groepen De stoet begint 
met een autopubliciteitskaravaan deze bestaat uit wagens en vrachtwagens van de lokale handelaars en bedrijven 
die de firtelstoet steunen Tijdens het traject gooien de deelnemers verschillende snoep en gadgets naar 
de menigte Veel voorkomende gadgets zijn Het praalgedeelte wordt gestart door de lokale muziekgroepen van 
Zulte Olsene en Machelen Daarna volgt Den Zultsen Bok Een van rogge gemaakt lichaam met 
een van papier mache gemaakt hoofd voortgetrokken door een wagen met aanhangwagen Gevolgd door onze 
reuzen familie met als familieleden Ten slotte nemen er verschillende dans en muziekgroepen deel die 
elk hun eigen optreden uitvoeren op verschillende plaatsen Om diversiteit aan de stoet te geven 
nemen er elk jaar andere groepen deel aan de firtelstoet Na drie jaar kan een 
eerder deelgenomen groep terug deelnemen aan de stoet Elk jaar doen er à groepen mee 
die een kort toneelstuk opvoeren over de gebeurtenissen van het afgelopen jaar dit gaat van 
lokale politieke affaires tot grote wereldproblemen Deze gebeurtenissen worden op een amusante en anarchistische manier

Varenzaad is bekend uit volksverhalen uit de Lage Landen De mensen hebben zich eeuwenlang afgevraagd 
hoe een varen zijn zaad produceert In beschreef een beroemd man dat de kleine stipjes 
achter de bladeren de zaden zijn Men ging in de nacht van Sint Jan het 
bos in dit was de bloeinacht van de onzichtbare bloem Men nam aan dat het 
zaad uit de onzichtbare bloemen voor onzichtbaarheid zorgen kon Na het opzeggen van enkele spreuken 
viel het zaad om middernacht op een witte zakdoek Deze moest men opvouwen en men 
maakte dat men wegkwam Het was gevaarlijker om tijdens kerstnacht tussen elf en twaalf naar 
de kruising van wegen te gaan en een kring rond te trekken Half twaalf begon 
het te spoken en om kwartslag twaalf kwam de duivel zelf Je kreeg een papieren 
zakje met toverzaad maar je ziel was verloren Je kon leven als een prins maar 
je eindigde in de hel Een boer uit Groningen kreeg het spul per ongeluk De 
koeien waren uitgebroken en de boer zocht een halve dag Hij liep door een moeras 
en hij schold op zijn dieren De dieren rennen door de plassen en dan kijkt 
de boer achter zich hij ziet dat hij gevolgd wordt door een kronkelende hoop slangen 
Ze komen steeds dichterbij en de boer ziet een man uit de bosjes komen De 
boer vraagt wat hij moet doen en krijgt het mes van de vreemdeling De man 
moet een streep over het pad trekken en zo komt de boer heelhuids thuis Hij 
vertelt zijn vrouw wat er is gebeurd maar ze ziet hem niet Dan ziet de 
man hoe een groot licht wordt aangestoken in zijn veld en hij kan door de 
aarde heenkijken Hij rent op het licht af en wil de schat halen hij schopt 
zijn klompen uit om harder te kunnen lopen Dan ziet zijn vrouw hem opeens en 
ze vraagt waar hij naartoe gaat De man roept de schat te gaan halen maar 
het grote licht is inmiddels gedoofd Het visioen is verdwenen en aan de rand van 
de sloot blijft hij staan Hij vindt geen heuvel met verborgen schat en zijn vrouw 
heeft zijn klompen uitgeveegd en droogt ze met gloeiende kooltjes De man beseft dat de 
vreemdeling varenzaad in zijn klompen heeft gestrooid en wordt kwaad op zijn vrouw Zijn vrouw 
geeft hem een sneer terug en verdenkt hem zijn dieren uitgescholden te hebben Hiermee heeft 
haar man de duivel opgeroepen en het scheelde maar een haar of hij had hem 
te grazen genomen De boer is dodelijk geschrokken en loopt zwijgend het huis uit hij

Een blunder is een domme onverantwoorde fout met grote gevolgen voor de partij die de 
fout maakt Een blunder kan het vervolg zijn van het niet waarnemen van signalen of 
het verkeerd interpreteren van beschikbare informatie Het woord komt uit het oudnoors blundra wat betekent 
de ogen sluiten In die zin staat het woord blunder in verband met blind Blunders 
met minder zware consequentie worden ook wel faux pas of bloopers genoemd Een politicus of 
hoge militair zal niet gauw toegeven een blunder gemaakt te hebben maar toch worden achteraf 
gezien bepaalde beslissingen als een blunder gezien Voorbeelden daarvan zijn Albert Einstein beredeneerde dat het 
heelal moest uitdijen of inkrimpen Omdat hij dat niet acceptabel vond introduceerde hij de kosmologische 
constante Toen later werd vastgesteld dat het heelal inderdaad uitdijde noemde hij het de "grootste 
blunder" uit zijn leven Tegenwoordig wordt deze constante wel gebruikt om de toenemende snelheid van 
de uitdijing van het heelal te verklaren zie roodverschuiving Iedere schaker maakt weleens een blunder 
of hij nu huisschaker clubschaker of grootmeester is Als er bij een ingewikkeld idee een 
eenvoudige weerlegging over het hoofd wordt gezien spreekt men wel van schaakblindheid Andere bekende oorzaken 
van blunders zijn het vergeten van een weerlegging die men eerder wel had gezien en 
het zich vergissen in de volgorde van twee zetten of het denken dat een voorbereidende 
zet al is gedaan In de praktijk is de belangrijkste oorzaak van blunders echter dat 
men het begin van de partij langzaam heeft gespeeld en later eenvoudig de tijd tekortkomt 
om alle mogelijkheden te bekijken Hier volgt de partij tussen Anatoli Karpov en Matthew Sadler 
twee grootmeesters De partij werd in in Monaco gespeeld en begint met de Koningsindische opening 
zie diagram In het open Nederlands Kampioenschap te Dieren in juli maakte Sergej Tiviakov de 
blunder zich mat te laten zetten in zijn partij tegen Desiree Hamelink Zie diagram; de 
partij gaat verder met Er bestaat een stripfiguur met de naam Olivier Blunder en naar

De Onafhankelijkheidsmedaille van India in het Engels "Indian Independence Medal" was een in oktober door 
George VI van het Verenigd Koninkrijk ingestelde onderscheiding van de Dominion India India werd op 
augustus onafhankelijk het land werd een "Dominion" De herinneringsmedaille werd toegekend aan alle mannelijke en 
vrouwelijke leden van de Indiase strijdkrachten en de militairen die dienden in de legers van 
de tot India toegetreden semionafhankelijke heersers zoals de Maharadjas Ook de heersers zelf ontvingen deze 
medaille Het Koninklijk Besluit van George VI bestemde de medaille voor "de Britse die na 
de onafhankelijkheid in het land bleven om te helpen bij de verdeling en reorganisatie van 
de strijdkrachten van India" Zij kregen deze medaille wanneer zij op januari nog steeds in 
dienst waren Ook de Gurkhas en allerlei civiel personeel dat aan het leger was verbonden 
kwam in Aan de strijdkrachten verbonden burgers die voor de overheid in Delhi of in 
de provincies werkten ontvingen de medaille Ook de militairen van de Britse RAF de transporteenheden 
bleven nog enige tijd in India werkzaam en kwamen voor de medaille in Omdat India 
na het uitroepen van de republiek in nòg een Onafhankelijkheidsmedaille liet slaan nu zonder de 
kroon en de titels van de koning wordt deze medaille ook wel de "Indian Independence 
Medal De ronde millimeter brede medaille is vervaardigd van een goedkope legering van koper en 
nikkel Vóór de oorlog werden medailles in zilver geslagen Op de voorzijde is het nieuwe 
symbool van India Ashoka's chakra gedekt door de Britse kroon Daaromheen staat "Georgius VI D 
G BRITT OMN ROOD FID DEF" Dit was voor het eerst dat de nieuwe koninklijke 
titels met weglaten van een verwijzing naar het keizerrijk India werden gebruikt De bevestiging is 
zoals in GrootBrittannië vaak voorkomt een gesp met een draaimechanisme De economische positie van Engeland 
was slecht en ook de gesp is pover uitgevoerd met een goedkopere nietdraaibare rechte bolbevestiging 
aan de medaille De drager van de medaille wordt meestal op de rand vermeld Op 
de keerzijde staat het nationale embleem hier zonder motto met daaromheen "INDIAN INDEPENDENCE AUGUST Men 
draagt de medaille aan een centimeter breed lint met drie gelijke oranje witte en groene

Psilopa pulchripes is een vliegensoort uit de familie van de oevervliegen De wetenschappelijke naam van 
Delta is een reeks van eenmalig bruikbare draagraketten die sinds de jaren van de eeuw 
gebruikt worden door de Verenigde Staten De huidige Deltaraketten worden sinds geproduceerd en gelanceerd door 
United Launch Alliance Er waren per september in totaal Deltaraketten gelanceerd waarvan met succes Van 
de verschillende Deltaraketten is er nog een configuratie in gebruik de Delta IV Heavy De 
eerste Deltaraket was een aangepaste versie van de Thor de eerste ballistische raket van de 
United States Air Force De Thor zelf was midden jaren ontworpen met als doel Moskou 
te kunnen bereiken vanaf een lanceerplatform in het Verenigd Koninkrijk Voor de Delta werd de 
Thor voorzien van een tweede trap Hiervoor werd geëxperimenteerd met verschillende modellen rakettrappen waarvan het 
vierde ontwerp geschikt bleek De naam Delta is dan ook afgeleid van de Griekse letter 
Delta de vierde letter in het alfabet De volledige naam van de raket was officieel 
‘Thor Delta’ maar dit werd al snel afgekort tot simpelweg ‘Delta’ Van tot bleef de 
Thor de belangrijkste basis voor de eerste trap van de Deltaraketten NASA wilde de Deltaraketten 
gebruiken als tijdelijke oplossing voor het lanceren van communicatie meteorologische en onderzoekssatellieten alsmede maanverkenners gedurende 
en Daarna zou de Delta door een nieuw type raket moeten worden vervangen De Delta 
was verder meer gericht op betrouwbaarheid dan op prestatievermogen onder andere door onderdelen die bij 
de Thor vaak problemen gaven te vervangen In april kreeg Douglas Aircraft Company een contract 
om de Deltaraketten te bouwen voor NASA Het ontwerp was als volgt Deze voertuigen konden 
in totaal kilo aan vracht meenemen naar een baan om de aarde op tot kilometer 
hoogte De totale kosten voor de ontwikkeling van de eerste Deltaraketten bedroeg miljoen dollar miljoen 
meer dan begroot Van de lanceringen mislukte er één In besloot NASA langer door te 
gaan met de Delta en liet nog raketten bouwen Vanaf de introductie van de DeltaD 
in werden voor extra kracht vaste brandstofmotoren aan de zijkant van Delta’s toegevoegd Deze motoren 
uit de Castorserie werden door Thiokol nu onderdeel van Northrop Grumman vervaardigd Vanaf de Delta 
en werden de Castors vervangen door Graphite Epoxymotoren GEM van Alliant Techsystems ook onderdeel van 
Northrop Grumman Het belangrijkste verschil tussen Castors en GEM’s is dat de Castors van aluminium 
werden gemaakt terwijl GEM’s van het veel lichtere grafietepoxy zijn gemaakt Er zijn vier grote 
klassen Deltaraketten te onderscheiden Binnen deze klassen bestaan tal van verschillende modellen en ontwerpen Deze 
werden oorspronkelijk genummerd met letters van het alfabet Delta A Delta B enz In introduceerde 
McDonnell Douglas een nieuwe nummeringsysteem met getallen van elk vier cijfers Dit systeem was meer 
toepasbaar om de vele modificaties die voortdurend werden aangebracht bij te houden De Deltaraketten werden 
per revisie steeds krachtiger Anders dan bij de Delta's met lettercodering was de diameter van 
zowel eerste als tweede trap gelijk bij deze serie Delta's gelijk De rechte acht voet 
in diameter zijnde Delta kreeg daardoor de bijnaam "straight eight" rechte acht Begin jaren tachtig 
was besloten de Delta uit te faseren alle lanceringen moesten in de toekomst door de 
Spaceshuttle worden uitgevoerd Ook mislukten rond die tijd een aantal Deltalanceringen Na het Spaceshuttle ongeluk 
met de Challenger wilde men echter weer “Expendable Launch Vehicles” ELV’s voor satellietlanceringen Men wilde 
daarvoor geen levens riskeren Daarom moest er een betrouwbare gemoderniseerde Deltaraket komen Dit werd de 
Delta II In de tussentijd werden resterende voorraden Delta onderdelen van de oude Delta’s zoveel 
mogelijk opgebruikt Ook combineerde men oude Deltaonderdelen met nieuwe Delta IIonderdelen waardoor de tijdelijke Delta 
en ontstonden In werd met de introductie van de Delta II het systeem van de 
Romeinse cijfers geïntroduceerd De Delta II behield echter ook de vier cijferige codering om de 
configuratie aan te geven Zo was de eerste Delta II de serie" en is de 
serie een geüpgrade krachtiger Delta II Sinds werd de Delta II niet meer gebouwd maar 
er waren nog een vijf complete raketten op voorraad Op september werd voor de laatste 
keer een Delta II gelanceerd In totaal werden er gelanceerd waarvan succesvol De enige overgebleven 
Delta II zal in het bezoekerscentrum van het Kennedy Space Center worden geëxposeerd De Delta 
II is houder van het record van succesvolle lanceringen op rij De Delta III gebruikte 
een eerste trap die grotendeels overeenkwam met die van de Delta de diameter van de 
brandstoftanks was echter iets groter De sideboosters waren grotere staat voor de inch diameter in 
plaats van de van de Delta Voor de Delta III werd een nieuwe cryogene upperstage 
met een als hoofdmotor ontworpen De Delta III werd eind jaren slechts drie maal gelanceerd 
waarvan alleen de laatste deels succesvol was De Delta III kan worden gezien als een 
mislukt project maar was tegelijkertijd succesvol waar het ging om het ontwikkelen van nieuwe technieken 
Na annulering vond de zijn weg op een nieuwe zwaardere Delta IIconfiguratie de Delta IIheavy 
Het ontwerp van de tweede trap werd op de Delta IV hergebruikt Daarna werd met 
steun van de Amerikaanse Luchtmacht het EELV Delta IV ontwikkeld De Delta IV gebruikte dezelfde 
upperstage als de Delta III Voor de eerste trap werd de de eerste grote Amerikaanse 
raketmotor sinds de ontworpen Net als de Delta II heeft de Delta IV enkele tussentijdse 
upgrades gehad en zijn in meerdere configuraties inzetbaar De Delta IVHeavyconfiguratie was sinds de krachtigste 
actieve draagraket van de maar verloor begin die titel toen de Falcon Heavy voor het 
eerst vloog De Delta IV wordt vrijwel alleen voor militaire lanceringen gebruikt Uitzondering waren twee 
lanceringen van een Delta IVHeavy in opdracht van NASA omdat daarvoor geen ander type raket 
met vergelijkbare capaciteiten beschikbaar was De bouw van raket was te duur om mee te 
doen op de commerciële markt De laatste lancering zal in plaatsvinden Een aangepaste uitvoering van 
de tweede trap zal ook voor enkele vluchten van het Space Launch System worden gebruikt 
Veel Delta raketten hadden de typisch blauwe kleur die later Delta Blue ging heten In 
eerste instantie werden Delta’s wit geschilderd Om massa te besparen werd begin jaren besloten de 
witte verflaag niet langer aan te brengen waardoor de typisch blauwe grondverf zichtbaar werd Deze 
kleur ging symbool staan voor de Delta Op een Delta II zat ongeveer liter gallon 
AksoNobel “Blue Fluid Resistant Primer” Ook grote delen van de lanceerinstalaties waren met deze kleur 
beschilderd Bij de Delta IV was het niet mogelijk om diezelfde kleur te gebruiken Die 
raket heeft namelijk een laag roestbruin isolatieschuim om de brandstoftanks om te voorkomen dat de 
cryogene brandstoffen al te veel kunnen opwarmen Met de aankondiging van de Vulcan werd ook 
de definitieve uitfasering van de Delta II in en de Delta IV Medium aangekondigd ULA 
zal nog wel zolang als dat in nodig werd geacht de Delta IV Heavy blijven 
leveren De USAF verwachtte in voldoende alternatieve zeer zware EELV’s te hebben en dan dus 
de zeer dure Delta IV Heavy niet meer nodig te hebben De laatste Delta II 
vlucht werd in uitgevoerd en de laatste Delta IV Medium vlucht werd naar verschoven De 
laatste Delta IV Heavy wordt naar verwachting in gelanceerd Dit artikel of een eerdere versie 
ervan is een gedeeltelijke vertaling van het artikel Delta rocket family op de Engelstalige Wikipedia

Het wegennet van Frankrijk is een van de dichtst vertakte wegennetten ter wereld met een 
gezamenlijke lengte van ongeveer miljoen kilometer Het Franse wegennet bestaat uit verschillende lagen De hoogste 
laag zijn de autosnelwegen Autoroutes met een Anummer Dit zijn wegen die zijn uitgebouwd tot 
autosnelwegnormen Voor veel autosnelwegen moet tol betaald worden De tweede laag zijn de nationale wegen 
Routes nationales met een Nnummer Dit zijn de nietautosnelwegen die beheerd worden door de Franse 
staat Tot vormden ze een netwerk dat los stond van het autosnelwegennet maar doordat veel 
Nwegen die parallel aan autosnelwegen lagen in dat jaar zijn overgedragen aan de departementen vormen 
de nationale wegen nu een aanvullend netwerk De derde laag zijn de departementale wegen Routes 
départementales met een Dnummer Dit zijn de nietautosnelwegen die beheerd worden door de departementen De 
onderste laag zijn de lokale wegen Routes communales of Chemins met een Cnummer De wegnummering 
van de autosnelwegen en nationale wegen is nationaal geregeld De nummering van de departementale wegen 
en lokale wegen zijn departementaal en lokaal geregeld Daardoor komt hetzelfde wegnummer in meerdere departementen 
voor en veranderen de nummers van deze wegen vaak aan de grenzen van de departementen 
Op de autosnelwegen worden blauwe borden met witte tekst gebruikt Op de overige wegen worden 
witte borden met zwarte tekst gebruikt Belangrijke steden points verts worden buiten de autosnelwegen aangegeven 
op een groene achtergrond zodat ze beter opvallen tussen de kleinere doelen Het lettertype dat 
in Frankrijk wordt gebruikt is Caractères Voor interlokale doelen wordt kapitaalschrift met hoofdletters gebruikt Voor 
lokale doelen wordt cursiefschrift schuin gebruikt Autosnelwegen de autoroutes in Frankrijk kunnen in twee groepen 
worden onderverdeeld Langs praktisch alle Franse autosnelwegen is FM actief Dit station zendt veel muziek 
uit met elk kwartier actuele verkeersinfo Op FM kan je ook TMCinfo ontvangen langs de

Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann Koningsbergen januari Berlijn juni was een Duits auteur componist dirigent jurist 
en tekenaar Zijn laatste voornaam luidde eigenlijk Wilhelm maar uit bewondering voor Mozart veranderde hij 
deze in Amadeus Van beroep was Hoffmann jurist maar daarnaast was hij een hartstochtelijk muziekliefhebber 
succesvol muziekrecensent en In overleed hij door nerveuze uitputting en overmatig drankgebruik In Bamberg is 
sinds het museum ETA HoffmannHaus aan hem gewijd Als schrijver bleek Hoffmann meeslepend origineel en 
geniaal te zijn zoals blijkt uit zijn in geschreven Ritter Gluck over de bekende componist; 
Die Elixiere des Teufels uit over fatalisme en onmacht Daarna komen de Nachtstücke de Phantasiestücke 
en Die Serapionsbrüder uit allemaal geschreven tussen en Hoffmanns verhalen zijn geschreven in een uiterst 
jachtige pathetische stijl die de lezer geen enkele rust gunt Veelvuldig maakt hij gebruik van 
Met deze vertelstijl is hij in volle eeuw al een uitgesproken modernist dit samen met 
zijn geestverwanten Heinrich Heine en wellicht nog meer Heinrich von Kleist Deze levendigste onder de 
Duitse prozameesters van de negentiende eeuw werd vertaald door oa Simon Vestdijk die ons niet 
geheel toevallig ook een volledige vertaling bezorgde van een andere Hoffmannadept Edgar Allan Poe Ook 
Louis Couperus en Gerard Reve behoorden tot de gretigste lezers van Hoffmanns vertellingen Hoffmanns oeuvre 
bevat hallucinatie humor het bovennatuurlijke en duivelse Hij heeft hiermee schrijvers als Dostojevski Dickens Poe

Steirodon dentiferum is een rechtvleugelig insect uit de familie sabelsprinkhanen Tettigoniidae De wetenschappelijke naam van 
Bevo Heldia Combinatie is een handbalvereniging uit Panningen in de Nederlandse provincie Limburg De vereniging 
is ontstaan door een fusie tussen BEVO uit Beringe en Heldia uit Panningen in In 
het bestaan van de club wist de herenkant eenmaal het landskampioenschap en de beker te 
winnen en driemaal werd de Supercup gewonnen Sinds de promotie uit de eerste divisie in 
speelt het herenteam op het hoogste niveau handbal in Nederland De dameskant wist geen enkele 
landelijke titel te behalen Op oktober zijn de twee handbalverenigingen in de gemeente Helden Heldia 
en FancomBEVO besprekingen begonnen om tot een betere samenwerken te komen "Wij willen de beschikbare 
uren in de sporthal efficiënter gaan gebruiken en de handbalsport promoten Dat kun je beter 
met twee clubs doen dan in je eentje” als dus de toenmalige voorzitter van Heldia 
Persbericht rond de jaarwisseling van en dat er een fusering plaatsvond tussen de handbalverenigingen BEVO 
en Heldia De leden van beide clubs gaven de goedkeuring De nieuwe clubnaam en clubkleuren 
werden snel daarna ook bekendgemaakt De nieuwe fusie zou de naar HV BEVO Heldia Combinatie 
heten met de kleuren Geelgroen Door middel van deze fusie wil de nieuwe vereniging een 
positieve bijdrage leveren aan het handbalniveau in de gemeente en daarnaast de aanwas de breedtesport 
en het recreatieve handbal nieuwe impulsen te geven Daarbij zal ook veel aandacht besteed worden 
aan de jeugd in het algemeen Ook de interne opleiding en begeleiding van de trainers 
en coaches krijgt een hoge prioriteit De vorming van een sterk kader zal zeer zeker 
niet vergeten worden Op mei maakte Heldia en BEVO bekent om niet te fuseren De 
gemeente Helden wilde ook een duitje in het zakje doen en niets leek een fusie 
van de twee handbalverenigingen in de weg te staan Plotseling moesten alle plannen de koelkast 
in en uiteindelijk ontaardde de zo vreedzaam begonnen onderhandelingen zelfs in een ordinaire burenruzie "We 
gaan hier niet uit de doeken doen wat er zich allemaal afspeelde Geen fusie handbalvereniging 
Heldia met BEVO" Aldus de voorzitter van Heldia Op april deelde de heer E Gielen 
namens het bestuur van BEVO aan het bestuur van Heldia mede dat een fusie op 
financiële gronden van geen doorgang kan vinden Op februari werd er weer opnieuw vergaderd onder 
voorzitterschap van Mw Wayen en dhr Vossen van het NHV afdeling Limburg En werd de 
intentie tot samenwerking dus te komen tot een fusie uitgesproken De gemeente Helden verleende hun 
medewerking en gelden ter beschikking te stellen onder voorwaarde dat de fusie doorgang zou vinden 
Per juli zou BEVO en Heldia onder de nieuwe naam spelen BEVO Heldia Combinatie De 
herenkant van de fusieclub weet in de beginjaren enkele kleine successen te boeken maar weet 
geen stabiele factor te worden in de eredivisie In wordt het herenteam eerste in de 
eerste divisie maar degradeert in weer terug naar de eerste divisie Na twee seizoenen in

Bernard Cornelis Johannes Loder Amsterdam september Den Haag november was een vooraanstaand Nederlands rechtsgeleerde op 
het gebied van het internationaal recht Hij werd de eerste voorzitter van het Permanent Hof 
van Internationale Justitie Loder studeerde rechten aan het Athenaeum Illustre de voorloper van de Universiteit 
van Amsterdam Hij promoveerde in te Leiden op de leer van de volkssoevereiniteit waarbij hij 
de volkssoevereiniteit als grondslag van de staat verwierp Zijn opvattingen waren conservatiefliberaal hetgeen onder meer 
bleek doordat hij zich in uitliet tegen het algemeen kiesrecht en hij hing de Historische 
School van Friedrich Carl von Savigny aan Codificaties moesten volgens deze School op de eerste 
plaats "wetenschappelijk" zijn waarbij ze maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen eerder volgden dan beïnvloedden Wetenschappelijke wetten konden uitsluitend 
door wetenschappelijk geschoolde juristen worden gemaakt Het idee van volkssoevereiniteit paste niet in die gedachte

recht waren inmiddels ver ontwikkeld In zijn Institutions judiciaires et de conciliation uit pleitte hij 
voor de oprichting van een permanent internationaal gerechtshof en van een raad voor de verzoening

Ester Boserup geboren Børgesen Kopenhagen mei Ascona september was een Deens econoom en demograaf die 
zich specialiseerde in economische en agrarische ontwikkeling Ze werkte onder meer voor de Verenigde Naties 
en andere internationale organisaties Boserup is bekend door haar theorie van agrarische intensivering die ingaat 
tegen de malthusiaanse catastrofe De theorie van Boserup stelt dat bevolkingsdruk innovatie in de hand 
werkt in de landbouw waarmee de voedselproductie verhoogd wordt om de bevolkingsgroei te faciliteren Daarmee 
ging zij in tegen Thomas Malthus die juist stelde dat de bevolkingsgroei uiteindelijk beperkt wordt 
door de grenzen van de landbouwproductie Ester Børgesen was de enige dochter van een ingenieur 
die de zoon was van een textielondernemer die overleed aan diabetes mellitus toen zij twee 
jaar oud was Kort daarna maakte een crisis in de textielindustrie dat de familie hun 
kapitaal verloor zodat Boserup in armoede opgroeide Haar moeder moedigde haar aan te studeren en 
in toen zij negentien was begon zij aan de Universiteit van Kopenhagen Toen zij eenentwintig 
was trouwde zij Mogens Boserup Tijdens haar studie was zij enige tijd aangesloten bij de 
Deense Clartébeweging tot deze over werd genomen door de Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti In studeerde zij 
af als candpolit in theoretische economie met daarnaast sociologie en landbouwbeleid De crisis van de 
jaren was van grote invloed op haar keuze voor meerdere vakgebieden Voor haar afstuderen richtte 
zij zich op de Amerikaanse institutionele economie en de crisistheorie van Karl Marx In kwam 
The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money van John Maynard Keynes uit en vergeleek 
Boserup de geneigdheid om te consumeren van Keynes met de marxistische onderconsumptietheorie Na haar afstuderen 
begon zij voor de Deense overheid te werken op de afdeling die in was opgezet 
toen de Deense exportprijzen instorten en de import aan banden werd gelegd Zij richtte haar 
aandacht op de verschillen tussen grote en kleine landen bij vrijhandel en protectionisme en staatsinterventie 
Zo bekritiseerde zij de steun die de Deense overheid gaf aan de productie van boter 
en varkensvlees waarvan zij vreesde dat dit op de langere termijn eerder het effect van 
een slaappil zou hebben dan van een versterkend medicijn In deze periode kreeg zij drie 
kinderen dochter Birte in en zonen Anders in en Ivan in In begon zij te 
werken voor de Europese economische commissie van de Verenigde Naties ECE en verhuisde met haar 
man naar Genève Ook hier lag haar nadruk op handel en landbouw en schreef zij 
onder meer over het verwoestende effect van voedselhulp op de landbouw in Afrika Zij onderzocht 
ook of er een verband was tussen de lage economische groei van Frankrijk en de 
geringe bevolkingsgroei In begonnen zij en Mogens te werken met Gunnar Myrdal ook van de 
ECE Samen onderzochten zij voor het Twentieth Century Fund de economische ontwikkeling van India Tijdens 
haar reizen door India kwam zij tot de conclusie dat de westerse ideeën over landbouwproductie 
meerarbeid bevolkingsdichtheid en migratie niet of nauwelijks opgingen voor India Boserup werd steeds sceptischer over 
de bestaande ontwikkelingstheorieën wat niet overeenkwam met de ideeën van Myrdal Als malthusiaan ging Myrdal 
er vanuit dat de bevolkingsgroei in Azië de economische groei zou afremmen Na de voltooiing 
in van het overeengekomen onderzoek ging Boserup dan ook geen verder onderzoek meer met hem 
aan en keerde zij met haar man terug naar Denemarken Myrdal publiceerde het onderzoek in 
als Asian Drama An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations In Denemarken werkte zij als 
consultant voor de regionale overheid en de Voedsel en Landbouworganisatie FAO in Rome Aan de 
hand van gegevens van de FAO kwam zij tot de conclusie dat de verschillende methodes 
van vruchtwisseling en het langdurig braak laten liggen geen aanpassing was aan omgeving of cultuur 
maar afhankelijk was van de bevolkingsdichtheid Boserup ontving een eredoctoraat van de Universiteit van Kopenhagen 
de Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen en de Brownuniversiteit In werd zij lid van de National Academy of 
Sciences In publiceerde Boserup The Conditions of Agricultural Growth The Economics of Agrarian Change Under 
Population Pressure Hierin ging zij in tegen het idee van Malthus en zijn aanhangers dat 
voedselproductie inelastisch is en daarmee een beperkende factor voor de bevolkingsgroei Volgens die visie is 
bevolkingsgroei een afhankelijk variabele die bepaald wordt door de landbouwproductiviteit Die is dan afhankelijk van 
toevallige factor van technische uitvindingen en imitatie die de productiviteit beïnvloeden worden dan gezien als 
bijkomende variabele Boserup draaide dit om en deed haar onderzoek vanuit de aanname dat de 
bevolkingsgroei een onafhankelijke variabele is die een belangrijke factor is in de ontwikkeling van de 
landbouw Zolang er geen noodzaak is zijn er weinig aansporingen om de voedselproductie te verhogen 
Zelfs als uitvindingen bekend zijn worden deze niet noodzakelijk gebruikt zolang de bestaande methodes afdoende 
zijn Pas zodra er tekorten dreigen te ontstaan is de extra inspanning te rechtvaardigen die 
veelal gepaard gaat met agrarische intensivering en de bijbehorende nieuwe manieren van werken Er is 
de nodige kritiek op dit werk van Boserup John Caldwell stelde dat haar theorie waardevol 
was omdat deze de complexiteit weergaf van de invloed van bevolkingsgroei Haar theoretische model van 
landbouwontwikkeling was echter nauwelijks onderbouwd Daarnaast wilde Boserup aantonen dat Malthus en Myrdal er op 
elk vlak naast zaten mede doordat zij sterk gekant was tegen vormen van bevolkingsbeheersing wat 
haar argumenten regelmatig gekunsteld maakte Zo zag zij het sterftecijfer niet als bepalend voor de 
bevolkingsgroei terwijl dit centraal stond bij Malthus De voorbeelden die Boserup gaf waar het sterftecijfer 
geen invloed heeft op bevolkingsgroei lijken selectief en niet universeel Daarnaast stelde Boserup dat omdat 
intensivering een hogere werkdruk zou betekenen dit alleen plaatsvond onder bevolkingsdruk zelfs als innovaties al 
geruime tijd beschikbaar waren Daarmee zou een teruggang waarschijnlijker zijn dan een intensivering Problematisch was 
echter dat die teruggang in de praktijk nauwelijks plaatsvindt waarbij het paleffect mogelijk een rol 
William Darity stelde dat enerzijds de gegevens van Boserup over werkdruk voor voedselvergaring niet deugden 
en anderzijds dat de werkdruk mogelijk aanvankelijk hoger lag maar naarmate de ervaring groeide er 
steeds efficiëntere methodes gevonden Volgens Caldwell had Malthus te weinig oog voor innovatie in de 
landbouw en legde Boserup te veel nadruk op dreigende bestaanscrises als moment om innovaties te 
gaan gebruiken Hoewel Boserup inging tegen Malthus zijn de theorieën met elkaar te verenigen Ronald 
Demos Lee deed dit in en James W Wood in Lee zag het als mogelijk 
dat de theorie van Boserup slechts geldig was binnen een bepaalde bandbreedte waarbij de malthusiaanse 
effecten maken dat de bevolkingsgroei binnen die bandbreedte blijft Nadat Boserup The Conditions of Agricultural 
Growth had geschreven verbleef zij een jaar in Senegal waar haar man leiding gaf aan 
het African Institute for Economic Development and Planning IDEP van de Verenigde Naties Tijdens haar 
eizen door Afrika observeerde zij dat er sprake was van een vooral mannelijke migratie naar 
de steden waarbij de mannen geld naar huis stuurden en de vrouwen achterbleven om voedsel 
te verbouwen Haar daaropvolgende onderzoek resulteerde in in Woman's Role in Economic Development waarmee zij 
bijdroeg aan de discussie over gender en ontwikkeling Hierin ging zij onder meer in tegen 
de stelling van Margaret Mead dat de man het voedsel vergaart terwijl de vrouw het 
bereidt In het eerste deel van het boek onderzocht Boserup de rol van de vrouw 
in verschillende landbouwsamenlevingen Daar waar de vrouw op het land werkt is sprake van een 
bruidsprijs terwijl er een bruidsschat is als de vrouw niet meewerkt Daar waar vrouwen op 
het land werken en gebruiksrechten van land uitgebreid kunnen worden blijft polygamie bestaan Dit mechanisme 
blijkt bepalender te zijn dan welke religie aangehangen wordt Dit werk bracht haar een rol 
in de Commissie voor de status van de vrouw CSW van de Verenigde Naties Daarmee 
werd ze een drijvende kracht achter het Internationaal Jaar van de Vrouw en het Decennium

Christensen komt uit een extreem rijke familie en staat in navolging van zijn vader aan 
het hoofd van een miljardenbedrijf Hij houdt er een relatie op na met bediende Sam 
Lockwood Jessica Alba van wie hij oprecht houdt maar die hij ook geheim houdt voor 
zijn wantrouwende moeder Lilith Lena Olin Lilith is extreem begaan met haar zoon wat met 
name zo gegroeid is doordat hij lijdt aan een hartkwaal Deze zal hem het leven 
kosten als er niet tijdig een donor voorhanden komt Vanwege zijn intensieve medische verleden is 
Beresford daarnaast bevriend geraakt met de hem behandelende hartchirurg Jack Harper Terrence Howard Deze raadt 
hem aan in het hier en nu te gaan leven te trouwen met zijn grote 
liefde en haar niet langer geheim te houden Beresford weet immers totaal niet hoelang hij 
daar nog de kans voor heeft Beresford besluit dat Harper een punt heeft en trouwt 
diezelfde dag nog met Lockwood in een kleine ceremonie voor twee Een dag later wordt 
hij gebeld met de mededeling dat er een donorhart beschikbaar is Zijn moeder wil de 
transplantatie laten uitvoeren door een door haar geregeld landelijk vooraanstaand specialist Beresford zelf blijft niettemin 
bij zijn besluit dat zijn vriend Harper het mag doen omdat hij die vertrouwt Wanneer 
Beresford een algehele narcose ondergaat merkt hij dat er iets helemaal fout zit Hij heeft 
inderdaad zijn ogen gesloten maar krijgt te kampen met 'onbedoeld intraoperatief bewustzijn' hij kan niets 
bewegen of zeggen maar is zich volledig bewust van alles wat er om hem heen 
en met zijn lichaam gebeurd Hij is onder narcose maar wel wakker tijdens de operatie 
Tot overmaat van ramp hoort hij hulpeloos toe hoe Harper met zijn operatieassistenten Dr Puttnam 
Fisher Stevens en Penny Carver Georgina Chapman een complot bespreken waarbij ook zijn kersverse echtgenote 
Lockwood betrokken is Ze willen het te implanteren hart onbruikbaar maken voor ze het inbrengen

Leopold I Leopold Ignatius Joseph Balthasar Felician; Hongaars I Lipót Wenen juni – aldaar mei 
was bijna een halve eeuw heerser als RoomsDuitse keizer koning van Hongarije en koning van 
Bohemen Leopold was een lid van het huis Habsburg als de tweede overlevende zoon van 
keizer Ferdinand III en zijn eerste vrouw Maria Anna van Spanje Zijn grootouders langs moeders 
kant waren Filips III van Spanje en Margaretha van Oostenrijk Hij was ook een volle 
neef van zijn rivaal Lodewijk XIV van Frankrijk Hij werd kroonprins op juli door de 
dood van zijn oudere broer Ferdinand IV en heerste als RoomsDuitse keizer van tot Leopolds 
heerschappij werd gekenmerkt door militaire successen tegen het Ottomaanse Rijk in de Grote Turkse Oorlog 
door zijn grootste generaal prins Eugenius van Savoye waaronder bij Szentgotthárd Wenen Mohács en Zenta 
Tegen het einde van de oorlog had de Habsburgse monarchie Transsylvanië en een groot deel 
van Hongarije geannexeerd Leopold staat ook bekend om zijn conflicten tegen Frankrijk in de Negenjarige 
Oorlog en de Spaanse Successieoorlog In de Spaanse Successieoorlog had hij gehoopt om het Tweede 
Partitieverdrag af te dwingen die de Spaanse troon toewees aan zijn zoon aartshertog Karel Leopold 
deed het zeer goed in deze oorlog en de Habsburgse monarchie behaalde beslissende overwinningen bij 
Schellenburg en Blenheim Na zijn dood in kwam zijn oudste zoon Jozef op de troon 
In zijn lange regeringsperiode jaar zag hij zich constant tegenover Lodewijk XIV van Frankrijk geplaatst 
De keizer was vreedzaam van aard en leidde nooit persoonlijk zijn troepen in het veld; 
toch werd een belangrijk deel van zijn leven bepaald en gevuld met het leiden en 
dirigeren van oorlogen en legers De eerste oorlog was tegen Zweden wiens koning Karel X 
een nuttige bondgenoot vond in George II Rákóczy vorst van Transsylvanië een rebellerende vazal van 
de kroon van Hongarije Oostenrijk voerde deze oorlog met het machtige Polen aan zijn zijde 
In werd de vrede van Oliva gesloten Turkse interventie in de zaken van Transsylvanië betekende 
vanaf een oorlog met het Heilige Roomse Rijk; na het arriveren van troepen uit delen 
van het Duitse rijk en Frankrijk begon in de strijd In boekte de grote keizerlijke 
generaal Raimondo Montecuccoli een opmerkelijke overwinning bij St Gotthard Bij de vrede van Vasvár sloot 
de keizer een twintigjarige vrede met de sultan Hij was hierbij genereuzer in de vredesvoorwaarden 
dan de recente overwinning noodzakelijk maakte De agressieve politiek van Lodewijk XIV tegen de Republiek 
der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden had de ernstige aandacht van Europa gekregen en stappen werden ondernomen 
om de politiek in te dammen Hoewel de Franse koning een alliantie zocht met verschillende 
Duitse prinsen die de Turken aanmoedigden in hun aanvallen op Oostenrijk nam de keizer eerst 
geen deel aan deze beweging Hij stond op vriendschappelijke voet met Lodewijk met wie hij 
nauw verwant was en met wie hij in reeds de verdeling van land van de 
Spaanse monarchie had besloten In had hij met hem een neutraliteitsverdrag gesloten In werd hij 
echter gedwongen actie te ondernemen Hij werd lid van een alliantie tot verdediging van de 
republiek De Hollandse Oorlog brak uit Toen zijn coalitie uiteenviel door toedoen van de keurvorst 
van Brandenburg vormde hij een nieuwe meer duurzame alliantie met Spanje en verscheidene Duitse prinsen 
jaar na de vrede van Westfalen was Duitsland echter een zeer onsamenhangend gebied geworden en 
het hoofd van het Duitse rijk kon moeilijk leiding aan de oorlogsinspanning geven De Vrede 
van Nijmegen in was dan ook in het voordeel van Frankrijk Leopold I is een 
van de keizers van het Heilige Roomse Rijk in een ononderbroken rij van vier wier 
muzikale kwaliteiten zich ook uitten in het zelf componeren van muziekstukken Leopold is drie keer 
getrouwd geweest Zijn eerste huwelijk was in met infanta Margaretha Theresia van Spanje dochter van 
koning Filips IV van Spanje Margaretha Theresia overleed in Uit dit huwelijk werden vier kinderen 
geboren twee zonen en twee dochters maar drie van hen stierven jong Zijn tweede huwelijk 
was in met aartshertogin Claudia Felicitas van Oostenrijk kleindochter in vrouwelijke lijn van Cosimo II 
de' Medici en in mannelijke lijn van Leopold V van Habsburg Claudia Felicitas stierf zelf 
in Uit dit huwelijk werden twee kinderen geboren die geen van beiden hun eerste verjaardag 
haalden Leopold trouwde voor de derde keer in met Eleonora van PaltsNeuburg dochter van keurvorst 
Filips Willem van de Palts Omdat zijn eerste twee huwelijken hem geen troonopvolger opgeleverd hadden 
was de druk op zijn nieuwe vrouw erg hoog Zij wist haar echtgenoot uiteindelijk tien 
kinderen te schenken waaronder twee overlevende zoons die beiden keizer van het Heilige Roomse Rijk

wel gerekend tot het impressionisme maar zijn werk valt vooral op door de onmiskenbare invloeden 
van Johannes Vermeer Paxton won op zijn achttiende een studiebeurs en ging naar Cowles Art 
School waar hij studeerde met de schilder Dennis Miller Bunker Een tijd lang volgde hij 
ook kunststudies te Parijs samen met JeanLéon Gérôme Na zijn terugkeer naar Boston studeerde hij 
opnieuw te Cowles met zijn vriend Joseph DeCamp en ontmoette zijn toekomstige vrouw Elizabeth Okie 
die daar ook studeerde en later veelvuldig model voor hem stond Na hun huwelijk vestigden 
ze zich in Newton Massachusetts Paxton maakte vooral naam als portretschilder en legde onder andere 
Grover Cleveland en Calvin Coolidge op het witte doek vast Hij maakte deel uit van 
de impressionistisch georiënteerde ‘Bostonse School’ en stond bekend om zijn buitengewone aandacht voor licht en 
detail Vaak schilderde hij geïdealiseerde jonge vrouwen in prachtige interieurs Hij werd daarbij vooral geïnspireerd 
door Johannes Vermeer wiens werkwijze hij nauwgezet bestudeerde Net als Vermeer legt hij de focus 
in zijn schilderijen niet overal gelijk en werkt hij het belangrijkste gedeelte van zijn schilderwerken 
vaak met meer detail uit Paxton gaf van tot les aan de Museumschool te Boston

Het Portret van Adèle BlochBauer I is een schilderij van de Oostenrijker Gustav Klimt Het 
wordt beschouwd als een topwerk van zijn arbeidsintensieve "gouden stijl" die maar weinig werken heeft 
voortgebracht Het is een schilderij van olieverf op doek van × cm Klimt werkte er 
zeker drie volle jaren aan tussen en hij maakte honderden schetsen en verwerkte er echt 
goud in Het werk is een collage met zwierige artnouveaukrullen abstracte geometrie en het ogenmotief 
van Egyptische goden Uit die drukke Byzantijns aandoende achtergrond kijkt het moderne gezicht zelfverzekerd maar 
wat melancholisch Klimt maakte van Adèle nog een tweede portret niet in goud maar in 
felle modernere kleuren Het schilderij "Adèle BlochBauer I" werd in juni volgens de New York 
Times voor de recordprijs van miljoen dollar miljoen euro verkocht Het doek werd gekocht door 
cosmeticamagnaat Ronald Lauder voor de Neue Galerie in New York een klein museum dat enkel 
werk van Duitse en Oostenrijkse kunstenaars tentoonstelt Adèle zal het topstuk worden van dit museum 
Zestig jaar lang was dit schilderij het uithangbord van de Galerie Belvedere in Wenen Het 
schilderij viel echter onder de "Naziroofkunst" omdat het van de joodse eigenaren was ontvreemd De 
Oostenrijkse overheid werd na een jarenlange juridische strijd verplicht het kunstwerk terug te geven aan 
de rechtmatige erfgenamen De claim rond de kunstverzameling van Jacques Goudstikker zorgde in het voorjaar 
in Nederland voor hetzelfde effect De erfgenamen van de familie BlochBauer waaronder Maria Altmann verkochten 
vervolgens het schilderij in juni De verkoopprijs was op dat moment het hoogste bedrag dat 
iemand ooit voor een schilderij heeft betaald In november overtrof een dripping van Jackson Pollock 
dat bedrag De film Woman in Gold van Simon Curtis uit is gebaseerd op het 
waargebeurd verhaal van Maria Altmann over de juridische strijd om kunstwerken waaronder het Portret van

De Parabellum of Para is een pistoolpatroon die werd geïntroduceerd in door de Duitse wapenfabrikant 
Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken DWM voor hun Hierdoor wordt deze patroon vaak aangeduid als voorganger 
van de was de Parabellum zelf een afstammeling van de Borchardt De Parabellum wordt over 
het algemeen gebruikt in pistolen machinepistolen en karabijnen Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog werd de patroon 
in gebruik genomen door de krijgsmacht van verschillende landen De naam Parabellum is afgeleid van 
het Latijnse Si vis pacem para bellum "Als je vrede wilt bereid je dan voor 
op oorlog" wat het motto en telegraafadres van de DWM was Georg Luger ontwikkelde de 
Parabellumpatroon uit de oudere Parabellumpatroon In presenteerde hij het nieuwe kaliber aan het British Small 
Arms Committee Ook werden drie prototypen gepresenteerd aan het Amerikaanse leger in Het Duitse leger 
erkende officieel interesse te hebben in Het originele ontwerp ontstond door de flessenhalsvorm te verwijderen 
uit de Parabellum wat leidde tot een licht toelopende tapered randloze rimless vorm De vorm 
van het projectiel werd aangepast in om de betrouwbaarheid bij het kameren te vergroten In 
de Tweede Wereldoorlog werd in Duitsland om lood te besparen een nieuw projectiel ontwikkeld dat 
een ijzeren kern had die omhuld werd met lood Deze patroon herkenbaar aan de zwarte 
mantel werd aangeduid als mE mit Eisenkern met ijzerkern In werd de zwarte mantel vervangen 
door een normale koperkleurige mantel Een andere variant uit die tijd was de SE Sintereisen 
"gesinterd ijzer" die ontstond door de gehele kogel te maken uit onder hoge temperatuur samengeperst 
ijzerpoeder Deze patroon is herkenbaar aan een donkergrijs projectiel Voor wapens met geluidsdemper werd een 
speciale lading met volledig metalen mantel full metal jacket ontworpen met een projectiel van g 
gr Deze is te herkennen aan een "X" op de bodem van de huls en 
een groen gelakte stalen huls Het doel was een subsonische lading te verkrijgen Deze lading 
werd gedurende de Tweede Wereldoorlog ontwikkeld door het Duitse leger andere landen volgden met eigen 
subsonische ladingen De heeft een beperkte terugslag Het grote voordeel is dat dit het kleinste 
onder de grote kalibers is en dus hebben pistolen vaak een grotere capaciteit in vergelijking 
met de SW en ACP Dit gecombineerd met de eerder vermelde beperkte terugslag zorgt ervoor 
dat de schutter meer schoten nauwkeurig in het doel kan plaatsen in kortere tijd Het 
grote nadeel van de is de neiging tot overpenetratie wanneer geen hollepuntkogels gebruikt worden Met 
gewone projectielen wordt dan een te kleine wondopening gemaakt zodat het projectiel door een lichaam 
gaat zonder veel schade te doen aan het omliggende weefsel Doordat de kogel nog energie 
overhoudt na door het doel te zijn gegaan is er kans dat er onbedoelde schade

Het actieve centrum is het gebied van een enzym waaraan het substraat bindt en waar 
de chemische reactie plaatsvindt die het enzym katalyseert Het actieve centrum kan voorgesteld worden als 
een holte in het Het actieve centrum is gevormd naar analogie van de structuur van 
het substraat Als gevolg hiervan kunnen de meeste enzymen alleen een interactie aangaan met een 
specifiek substraatmolecuul Deze specificiteit wordt bepaald door de ruimtelijke ordening van aminozuren binnen het actieve 
centrum Sommige enzymen moeten binden met bepaalde cofactoren om hun passende structuur aan te nemen 
of om een redoxreactie mogelijk te maken In het actieve centrum bevinden zich residuen bepaalde 
aminozuren binnen de polypeptideketen die tijdelijk bindingen aangaan met het substraat Het substraat wordt daardoor 
herkent en vastgehouden Daarnaast zijn er residuen die de reactie van het substraat katalyseren Dit 
zijn de residuen van de zogenaamde katalytische triade Het actieve centrum kan een reactie meermaals 
katalyseren omdat de residuen aan het einde van de reactie onveranderd zijn De residuen kunnen 
tijdens de reactie veranderen maar na afloop worden ze Ondanks dat er grote structuurverschillen bestaan 
tussen individuele enzymen delen de meeste actieve centra een aantal algemene kenmerken Ten eerste bestrijkt 
het actieve centrum slechts een klein deel van het totale Het gaat meestal om een 
in de diepte van het eiwit gelegen ruimte holte waarvan de wanden gevormd worden door 
de zijketens van veelal hydrofobe aminozuurresiduen Het actieve centrum ligt dus goed afgegrensd van het 
cytoplasma waardoor de enzymatische reactie in een optimale fysischchemische omgeving kan optreden Ten tweede berust 
de specificiteit van de enzymatische reactie grotendeels op een nauwkeurig aan het substraat aangepaste vorm 
van het actieve centrum Daar kunnen de atomen van het substraat en enzym elkaar dicht 
genoeg benaderen om nietcovalente interacties met elkaar aan te gaan Bij veel enzymen bevat het 
actieve centrum een ruimtelijke vorm die enigszins beweeglijk is Wanneer deze mobiliteit benut wordt om 
de vorm van het actieve centrum aan die van het subtraat aan te passen spreekt 
men van induced Zodra het substraat is gebonden en georiënteerd aan het actieve centrum kan 
katalyse van de reactie beginnen Door de vrijgekomen energie van de enzymsubstraatbinding kan het subtraat 
tijdelijk tot een andere ruimtelijke conformatie overgaan die de overgangstoestand wordt genoemd De aminozuurzijketens van 
de katalytische triade drie kritische aminozuren en cofactoren zoals NAD leveren de elektronen of waterstofionen 
die nodig zijn voor de chemische reactie Na de reactie wordt meestal een tweede overgangstoestand 
bereikt waaruit het reactieproduct ontstaat Het reactieproduct laat los en het enzym neemt zijn oorspronkelijke

heette het Käkisalmi Volgens de Finse overlevering werd de plaats gesticht op een plaats waar 
een koekoek gehoord werd käki betekent 'koekoek' in het Fins In de kronieken van Novgorod 
komt de naam Korela voor het eerst voor in in Zweedse kronieken een stuk later 
namelijk in In de dertiende eeuw werd er om de stad een vesting gebouwd In 
de eeuw werd Korela zelfs genoemd als de tweede stad van de Republiek Novgorod Gedurende 
twee periodes was Korela in Zweedse handen Finland maakte deel uit van Zweden van tot 
en met en van tot Tijdens de Zweedse overheersing werd de vesting KeksholmKexholm genoemd Toen 
in het gebied na de Grote Noordse Oorlog in Russische handen kwam bleef men de 
naam Keksholm aanhouden alleen werd het lichtelijk aangepast tot Keksgolm Кексгольм aangezien het Russische alfabet 
geen letter 'h' kent Toen Rusland heel Finland in aan haar rijk toevoegde werd het 
gebied samengevoegd met de rest van Finland en zodoende onderdeel van het Groothertogdom Finland Toen 
Finland in onafhankelijk werd was de stad deel van Finland In na het einde van 
de winteroorlog werd de stad volgens de Vrede van Moskou weer deel van de SovjetUnie 
De Finnen heroverden samen met de Duitsers het gebied in tijdens de vervolgoorlog maar sinds 
is het definitief in Russische handen Veel voormalige Finse plaatsen kregen na de oorlog een 
Russische naam; zo kreeg de stad in zijn huidige naam Priozersk Doordat de Sovjets een 
actieve immigratiepolitiek voerden mensen vanuit de hele SovjetUnie werden aangemoedigd zich hier te vestigen werd 
het gebied langzamerhand steeds Russischer en steeds minder FinsKarelisch De muren en torens van de

De Eiermarkt is een klein plein in Brugge Deze plek heette oorspronkelijk Bergpoel of Ten 
Berghpoele Galbert van Brugge beschreef het als een moerassige poel waarin men kon verdrinken en 
waarin soms lijken van geëxecuteerde misdadigers werden geworpen Men moet bedenken dat men zich hier 
aan de achterkant van de Grote Markt bevond De naam Bergpoel bleef in gebruik tot 
in Ondertussen kwam ook de naam Eiermarkt in gebruik die aanvankelijk meer op de activiteit 
dan op de plek betrekking had Het was immers de plaats waar modderpoel of niet 
de handel in zuivelproducten zijn centrum had In bestond er al een Boterhuis of Boterhalle 
De halle werd in herbouwd maar in verlaten voor het nieuwe Boterhuis in de SintJakobsstraat 
In werd de halle op de Eiermarkt wegens bouwvalligheid gesloopt De Eiermarkt bestaat uit drie 
delen De Eiermarkt loopt vanaf de hoek van de Markt met als begrenzing de Geldmuntstraat 
aan één zijde en de Kuipersstraat aan de andere De SintJakobsstraat mondt er in uit

De Piatra Craiului Duits Königstein is een gebergte in de Zuidelijke Karpaten in Roemenië Het 
is tevens een nationaal park De Piatra Craiului bestaat uit een smalle kalkrug van ongeveer 
kilometer lang De bergrug is noordwestzuidoost georiënteerd en ligt tussen het Făgărașgebergte en het Bucegigebergte 
Aan de zuidkant ligt het lagere Leaota gebergte Aan de noordkant dalen de flanken direct 
af naar het Zevenburgs Plateau De hoogste top heet La Om en heeft een hoogte 
van meter De eerste onderzoeken naar planten en vegetatie vonden al plaats in de eeuw 
In werden in het kader van een uitgebreid onderzoek door het Nationaal Park Piatra Craiului 
nog nieuwe soorten gevonden Er zijn soorten en ondersoorten van planten bekend Dit is van 
het totaal aantal in Roemenië De Garofița Pietrei Craiului een berganjer die alleen in dit 
gebergte voorkomt is het symbool voor het gelijknamige nationaal park van de in Roemenië aanwezige 
orchideen soorten kan men hier vinden De hoogste pieken liggen in de Alpiene zone Van 
de ongewervelde dieren komen er alleen in dit gebergte voor endemisch Een van de soorten 
ontdekte vlinders is het in Europa bijna verdwenen Er zijn soorten vogels bekend waarvan er 
beschermd zijn Het aantal roofvogels is vergeleken met de omliggende bergmassieven laag Bij de kleine 
zoogdieren vindt men soorten vleermuizen die huizen in de vele grotten De grote zoogdieren worden 
onder andere vertegenwoordigd door de bruine beer karpatengems edelhert wild zwijn lynx vos en wolf 
Deze dieren verspreiden zich via corridors naar het nabijgelegen Bucegigebergte De structuur van het gebergte 
verschilt sterk van de omliggende gebergtegroepen De eerste wetenschappelijke geologische onderzoeken vonden plaats in In 
typeerde de Franse geograaf Emannuel de Martonne het gebergte als 'een groot morfolgisch ongeluk' Op 
de kristallijne Schistlaag ligt een kalklaag met een dikte van meter in het zuiden tot 
meter in het noorden De kalklaag domineert van het gebergte De bijhorende karstverschijnselen komen tot 
uiting in diepe bergkloven in het noordwesten steile ravijnen ondiepe grotten en diepe verticale grotten 
Een hiervan is met meter verticaal de diepste van Roemenië Met name in het noorden 
van de keten is het kalkgesteente sterk gelaagd De hoek van de lagen loopt van 
graden in het zuiden naar verticaal in het noorden De vlakkere delen van het massief 
aan de noord en westkant zijn vanaf de eeuw toen migratie uit Brașov op gang 
kwam veelal ontdaan van bebossing en in gebruik als weides van de bossen is in 
handen van de staat; de rest is privéeigendom Het gevaar van illegale ontbossing is In 
het zuiden is met name in Rucăr en het nabijgelegen Câmpulung de houtindustrie de belangrijkste 
bron van inkomsten Zărneşti is de meest geïndustrialiseerde gemeente in de Piatra Craiului Door de 
economische crisis is de werkloosheid er hoog Het Plattelandstoerisme is het meest ontwikkeld in het 
oosten en zuiden Het toeristisch potentieel van het gebied is groot maar nog weinig benut 
Er zijn weinig statistieken bekend Circa mensen bezoeken jaarlijks het Nationaal Park De helft van 
hen deed dat met tenten deels buiten de officiële kampeerterreinen Een derde overnachtte in een 
van de berghutten en bivaks op de berg De rest vond plaats in een pension 
of hotel Slechts van de bezoekers kwam uit het buitenland Het gebied is geschikt voor 
activiteiten als wandelen mountainbiken en rotsklimmen Het is goed ontsloten met toegangen van uit het 
noorden Zarnesti en het zuiden Podu Dâmboviței Afdaling Wegwijzers Piatra Craiului BuilaVânturarița Călimani Ceahlău Cheile

Empetrum is een klein geslacht van groenblijvende dwergstruiken uit de heidefamilie Ericaceae Empetrumsoorten worden gevonden 
op het noordelijk halfrond in gematigde tot subarctische klimaatgebieden Ook kan men de planten in 
ZuidAmerika op de Falklandeilanden en op Tristan da Cunha aantreffen Het gangbare biotoop is in 
moerassen toendra's en veengebieden maar ook in naaldbossen Het geslacht kent een aantal soorten Empetrum 
nigrum Kraaihei en Empetrum eamesii zijn groenblijvende bodembedekkende struiken met kleine lichtgroene naaldvormige bladeren van 
cm lang De bloemen zijn klein en onopvallend De vrucht is een vrij droge zwartgekleurde 
bes die iets op een bosbes lijkt Op de Falklandeilanden komt de Empetrum rubrum voor 
Deze bloeit in oktober en de eerste rode besjes zijn rijp in januari De lokale 
bewoners maken hier jam van Het geslacht werd vroeger in een eigen familie de kraaiheidefamilie 
Empetraceae geplaatst maar DNAstudies hebben uitgewezen dat het geslacht in de heidefamilie Ericaceae thuis hoort 
In subpolaire gebieden zijn de bessen een belangrijk element in het dieet van de Inuit 
en de Saami Na afnemende populariteit wegens het gebrek aan smaak en de droge structuur 
is de bes nu aan een comeback bezig De planten geven een gelijkmatige opbrengst en 
zijn betrekkelijk gemakkelijk te oogsten Het anthocyaan kan als natuurlijke kleurstof gebruikt worden De Dena'ina 
Tanaina oogsten het als voedsel en slaan het soms in aanzienlijke hoeveelheden voor de winter 
op Ze mengen het met olie of reuzel Ze bewaren het op een koele plaats 
zonder voorbewerking De bessen worden in het najaar verzameld maar wanneer ze niet geplukt worden 
en er in het voorjaar nog zijn kunnen ze ook dan gegeten worden De rauwe 
bessen zijn melig en smakeloos De Inuit en inheemse Amerikaanse stammen mengen ze met andere 
bessen vooral met bosbessen Koken verbetert de smaak Ze`zijn geschikt voor gelei en taart De 
bladeren en stengels worden door de Dena'ina als medicijn tegen diarree en maagproblemen gebruikt Ze 
worden hiervoor gekookt of in heet water gedompeld Dit aftreksel wordt gedronken Sommigen claimen dat 
het bessensap goed is tegen nierproblemen In de plantkunde van de Dena'ina in het gebied 
van Lake Clark wordt ook de wortel als medicijn tegen oogproblemen gebruikt De inhoud van 
de bessen bestaat vooral uit water De vitamineconcentratie is laag Dit geldt ook voor de 
vrije vloeistoffen waardoor ze vrijwel reukloos zijn Acrothamnus Acrotriche Agapetes Agarista Andersonia Andromeda Arbutus Arctostaphylos

Stedelijk revanchisme is een begrip dat in de tweede helft van de jaren negentig is 
geïntroduceerd door de Amerikaanse geograaf Neil Smith Het was in de eerste plaats een poging 
om het stedelijke beleid van Rudy Giuliani de burgemeester van New York City van tot 
te karakteriseren Hierin stond zero tolerance ten aanzien van daklozen krakers drugsgebruikers prostituees en andere 
marginale groepen centraal Naar verloop van tijd signaleerde hij echter een wereldwijde tendens richting revanchisme 
in stedelijk beleid en stadsontwikkeling Volgens Smith is stedelijk revanchisme een bijproduct van gentrificatie het 
proces waarin een stadsdeel of buurt in economische sociale en culturele zin wordt opgewaardeerd door 
hernieuwde interesse en vestiging van midden en hogere inkomensgroepen Om deze kapitaalkrachtige groepen voor de 
stad te winnen of te behouden worden andere groepen die minder welvarend of anderszins afstotend 
voor de beoogde doelgroep zouden kunnen zijn verjaagd Dit gebeurt niet alleen door de stijging 
van de prijzen van het onroerend goed maar ook door privatisering van en verscherpt toezicht 
op de openbare ruimte Smith signaleert in dit verband een ontwikkeling waarin verzorgingsarrangementen zoals sociale 
woningbouw werkgelegenheidsprogramma's daklozenopvang et cetera worden afgebouwd ten gunste van commercialisering en economische revitalisering van 
binnensteden De geldigheid van Smiths bewering dat het hier om een wereldwijd verschijnsel gaat staat 
ter discussie In Europa gaat de stadsvernieuwing en herstructurering juist veelal gepaard met intensivering van 
sociale programma's In het Nederlandse grotestedenbeleid wordt bijvoorbeeld nadrukkelijk aangestuurd op sociaaleconomische en sociaalculturele menging 
van woonwijken vanuit de overtuiging dat daardoor de leefbaarheid in achterstandswijken kan worden verbeterd Niettemin 
is een tendens naar repressie zichtbaar getuige de opkomst van cameratoezicht alcohol en samenscholingsverboden en

Kromme Distelstraat is een hoekpand aan de Kromme Distelstraat en de Distelkade in AmsterdamNoord Het 
gebouw met invloeden van de Amsterdamse Schoolstijl dateert van Het toenmalige Gemeentelijke Woningdienst Amsterdam liet 
op deze plek een badhuis bouwen voor de nieuwe bevolking van Disteldorp eigenlijk een nooddorp 
voor opvang van de zeer snel groeiende bevolking van Amsterdam Die woningen werden nog opgeleverd 
zonder badkamer mensen konden gebruik maken van het badhuis met haar acht douchecabines Het ontwerp 
kwam daarbij van architect Berend Tobia Boeyinga Het is voor wat betreft ontwerp een zusje 
van het badhuis aan Zamenhofstraat Aangezien de geplande wijk destijds nog grensde aan landerijen kreeg 
het badhuis enigszins de vorm van een stolpboerderij Het woningbedrijf schatte in dat het gebouw 
en ook de wijk na vijfendertig jaar gesloopt kon worden vandaar geen "luxe" badkamer maar 
de Tweede Wereldoorlog gooide roet in het eten Bij herhaalde renovaties van de buurt waarbij 
badkamers werden ingebouwd in de woningen werd steeds overwogen het badhuis dan maar te slopen 
maar het overleefde steeds Het badhuis werd gesloten in mensen die toen nog geen badkamer 
hadden moesten uitwijken naar het verderop gelegen badhuis aan de Zamenhofstraat of naar het Eduard 
Douwes Dekkerhuis bejaardenflat Daarna kwamen er sloopplannen maar die werden keer op keer uitgesteld Het 
gebouw bleef uiteindelijk gespaard vanwege het feit dat zowat de gehele omgeving rond het badhuis 
tot gemeentelijk monument werd verklaard Door de leegstand werd het huisje wel eens beklad de

Quentin Meillassoux Parijs is een Frans filosoof Hij geeft momenteel les aan het École Normale 
Supérieure en is de zoon van de antropoloog Claude Meillassoux Hij is de voornaamste voorstander 
van de positie van het speculatief realisme Meillassoux is een student van de filosoof Alain 
Badiou die ook het voorwoord op Meilassoux' eerste werk Après la finitude heeft Tevens was 
hij leerling aan het Lycée LouisleGrand Badiou stelt dat Meilassoux in dit werk een gehele 
nieuwe weg uittekent voor de hedendaagse filosofie verschillend van Immanuel Kants drie alternatieven van criticisme 
scepticisme en In dit boek stelt Meillassoux dat de filosofie na Kant gedomineerd wordt door 
wat Meillassoux noemt "correlationisme" dat de idee beschrijft dat de mens niet zonder de wereld 
kan bestaan noch de wereld zonder de Meillassoux stelt echter dat dit een oneerlijke stap 
is waardoor de filosofie het probleem van hoe de wereld te beschrijven zoals hij echt 
is aan de kant kan zetten In navolging van Badiou en diens interesse voor wiskunde 
stelt Meillassoux dat we juist met de wiskunde de primaire eigenschappen als uitgebreidheid massa van 
de wereld kunnen bereiken in tegenstelling tot de waarneming die enkel die secundaire kwaliteiten als 
kleur geur bereikt Daarnaast probeert Meillassoux ook aan te tonen dat men dit "agnostisch scepticisme" 
dat stelt dat we niet zeker kunnen weten of er wel zoiets is als oorzakelijkheid 
moeten omzetten in de radicale zekerheid dat zoiets als oorzakelijkheid in het geheel niet bestaat 
Hij stelt verder dat hieruit volgt dat het eigenlijk noodzakelijk is dat alle natuurwetten contingent 
zijn De wereld is een soort van grote chaos waarin de wet van de toereikende 
grond moet worden verlaten hoewel de wet van de noncontradictie nog wel geldt Om deze 
redenen verwerpt Meillassoux de klassieke metafoor van Kants Copernicaanse revolutie in de filosofie Het is 
immers net Kant die de wereld doet afhangen van de wijze waarop de mens haar 
observeert wat resulteerde in het Duits idealisme Meillassoux spreekt dan ook over Kants werk als 
Kashta was een koning van Koesj en farao van de dynastie van Egypte Kashta vChr 
was de stamvader van de koningen van Koesj die Egypte in de eeuw voor Christus

OpperEgypte te versterken door zijn dochter Amenirdis I als "de vrouw van Amon" aan te 
stellen in Thebe Door vondsten van zijn regering in Elephantine kunnen we ervan uitgaan dat 
hij deze gebieden politiek beheerste De regeringsduur van Kashta is onbekend Sommige bronnen geven Kashta 
aan als de stichter van de Koesjitische dynastie omdat hij de eerste heerser van Koesj 
was die zijn invloed in een deel van Egypte verspreidde Kashta werd opgevolgd door zijn

Gareth John Evans Melbourne september is een Australisch politicus Hij was minister voor verschillende departementen 
waarvan het langst voor buitenlandse zaken Evans studeerde af aan de universiteit van Melbourne in 
kunst en rechten Daarna studeerde hij aan de universiteit van Oxford en slaagde hij voor 
een combistudie in filosofie politiek en economie Hij werkte vervolgens als advocaat in Melbourne waarbij 
hij zich specialiseerde in vakbonden Van tot was hij docent rechtsgeleerdheid aan de universiteit van 
Melbourne Daarnaast was hij actief voor de Australian Labor Party Hij behoorde tot de rechtervleugel 
van de partij en ondersteunde in Bob Hawke nadat de regering van Edward Whitlam was 
gevallen Verder zette hij zich in voor burgerrechten en werd hij benoemd als vicevoorzitter van 
de Victoria Council for Civil Liberties In werd hij gekozen voor de senaat een plaats 
waar hij twee jaar eerder naast had gegrepen en was vanaf Attorney General van de 
oppositie In steunde hij Hawke in zijn strijd tegen zijn partijgenoot Bill Hayden Hawke won 
daarna de verkiezingen van waarop Evans de verantwoordelijkheid over het ministerie van justitie kreeg In 
deze tijd raakte hij in een controverse betrokken en liep hij de bijnaam Biggles op 
uit het gelijknamige stripverhaal omdat hij militair materieel had gebruikt om luchtfoto's te laten maken 
van de bouw van de stuwdam in Tasmanië In december kreeg hij de verantwoordelijkheid over 
de ministerspost voor natuurlijke hulpbronnen en energie Vervolgens werd hij vanaf minister voor transport en 
telecommunicatie een functie waarvoor hij weinig interesse toonde Daarentegen was het zijn ambitie om de 
positie van Hayden als minister van buitenlandse zaken te erven wat uiteindelijk ook gebeurde in 
september Op deze post bleef hij vervolgens zeven en half jaar werkzaam De buitenlandpolitiek van 
Evans bestond eruit zijn land af te wenden van de traditionele partners ofwel het Verenigd 
Koninkrijk en de Verenigde Staten en nauwere banden aan te knopen met Aziatische buren De 
banden met het VK en de VS verkoelden dan ook alras tijdens zijn ministerschap niet 
op zijn minst omdat Evans vaak een afwijkende mening verdedigde Hij hielp verder bij de 
bevrijding van Cambodja van de bezetting door Vietnam wat in tot vrije verkiezingen leidde Op 
grond van de verbeterde betrekkingen met de Aziatische buren werd het mogelijk de APEC en 
de ASEAN te vormen Onder de regering van Paul Keating werd Evans vanaf regeringsleider in 
de Australische senaat en droeg hij bij aan enkele hervormingen in de binnenlandse politiek waaronder 
de afschaffing van de afhankelijkheid van kleine partijen bij het tot stand komen van wetsontwerpen

wens die hij al langer koesterde om een meer leidinggevende rol binnen zijn partij te 
verwerven Hetzelfde jaar verloor Keating echter de verkiezingen waardoor Labour in de oppositie kwam en 
er voor Evens een rol als vicevoorzitter van de fractie restte Na de nederlaag van 
zijn partij bij de verkiezingen van besloot hij zich in september terug te trekken uit 
de actieve politiek Tussen en was hij voorzitter van de International Crisis Group en deelde 
hij het voorzitterschap van de International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty ICISS van de 
Verenigde Naties In benoemde de VN hem samen met Yoriko Kawaguchi de voormalig minister van 
buitenlandse zaken van Japan als voorzitter van de International Commission on Nuclear NonProliferation and Disarmament 
Hier deed hij pionierswerk op het gebied van het Responsibility to Protect Concept dat stelt 
dat nationale soevereiniteit niet langer kan dienen als een protectieschild voor landen die niet in 
staat zijn hun eigen burgers te beschermen tegen gruweldaden en genocide In werkte Evans samen 
met Desmond Tutu Bob Geldof en Richard Branson mee aan de documentaire Soldiers of Peace

Olympisch Stadion Amsterdam Voor het eerst werd het evenement waarvan de organisatie wederom in handen 
lag van de Amsterdamse atletiekvereniging Phanos in samenwerking met de Atletiekunie uitgesmeerd over vier dagen 
De voornaamste redenen hiervoor waren dat men een groter aantal atleten wilde laten ervaren hoe 
het is om een meerdaags evenement mee te maken met voorrondes en finales en tegelijkertijd 
meer sporters een kans wilde geven op deelname aan een NK Vanwege deze maatregel konden 
enkele kampioenschappen op estafettenummers aan het programma worden toegevoegd Tevens werd het programma uitgebreid met 
het NK meerkamp dat in het verleden steeds apart van de baankampioenschapen werd georganiseerd De 
kampioenschappen stonden in het teken van de wereld kampioenschappen in Peking Er werd tijdens de 
NK door Femke Pluim een Nederlandse record verbeterd bij het polsstokhoogspringen dat door haar werd 
gewonnen met m een aanscherping van haar eigen record van enkele maanden ervoor met vijf 
centimeter Bij het hinkstapspringen evenaarde Fabian Florant met m zijn nationale record uit Thijmen Kupers

De zaak die de geschiedenis in ging als de Baarnse moordzaak was een geruchtmakende affaire 
die speelde tussen en Het betrof de moord die in werd gepleegd door de toen 
Boudewijn Henny zijn broer Ewout Henny en hun vriend Hennie Werkhoven op de toen Theo 
Mastwijk uit Soest De broers Henny kwamen uit een vooraanstaande Baarnse familie Het lichaam van 
het slachtoffer werd eind oktober gevonden De zaak diende anderhalf jaar later voor de rechtbank 
te Utrecht van maandag tot en met vrijdag maart Het lichaam van Theo Mastwijk werd 
op vrijdag oktober bij toeval gevonden door een metselaar die een oude beerput leeg schepte 
in de tuin van Huize Canton een kapitale Baarnse villa waar het gezin Henny woonde 
Tevens was in het pand het familiebedrijf gevestigd een groot verzekeringsbedrijf dat was opgericht door 
de overgrootvader van Boudewijn en Ewout en waarvan hun vader in die tijd directeureigenaar was 
Onderzoek wees uit dat het slachtoffer ongeveer een jaar daarvoor omgebracht was; later kwam aan 
het licht dat de moord gepleegd was op de avond van augustus Daarna werd zijn 
lichaam in de put met ongebluste kalk bedekt waardoor het ontbindingsproces werd versneld zodat slechts 
gebeente werd gevonden De Telegraaf publiceerde op november een voorpaginaartikel dat een nauwkeurige tijdlijn suggereert 
van de moord … werd de oude … reeds blootgelegd en geopend vóórdat deze Theo 
Mastwijk red om het leven gebracht werd En ongebluste kalk werd weinige uren vóór de 
moord gestolen bij een Baarnse leverancier van De begrafenis van Theo Mastwijk vond plaats op 
november Zo kort na de vondst van het lichaam kon de werkelijke overlijdensdatum niet direct 
worden vastgesteld op het graf werd augustus aangegeven Later bleek dat de werkelijke sterfdag moest 
worden bepaald op augustus De 'Baarnse moordzaak' beheerste maandenlang het nieuws Al snel werd geoordeeld 
dat er sprake zou zijn van klassenjustitie Allereerst omdat de verdachte Boudewijn tijdens het voorarrest 
kon ontsnappen uit het Baarnse politiebureau en vervolgens na twee dagen gewoon thuis bleek te 
zitten Officier van justitie mr Overbeek kwam hem met zijn privéauto persoonlijk ophalen en reed 
hem naar het politiebureau waarna deze officier in de landelijke pers een lawine van beschuldigingen 
over zich kreeg In justitiële kringen meenden sommigen dat de officier daarbij juist had gehandeld 
omdat het hier ging om een jeugdige verdachte Niettemin kwamen er Kamervragen en kreeg Overbeek 
een berisping van minister van Justitie ACW Beerman Bovendien ging het om 'rijkeluisdaders' miljonairszonen; hun 
vader was directeur van verzekeringsmaatschappij Conservatrix die zich moesten verantwoorden voor de moord op een 
jongen uit een lager sociaal milieu Indertijd viel op dat de broers tijdens hun straf 
anders werden behandeld dan andere delinquenten Zo mochten ze tijdens het uitzitten van hun straf 
met vakantie en werden ze zeilend op het water gezien Dat inspireerde Gerard Cox in 
het liedje Een broekje in de branding tot een verwijzing in de tekst Dobbert het 
aan tegen een miljonair of bollebof of tegen een welgestelde delinquent met zeilverlof Op april 
wees de arrondissementsrechtbank Utrecht vonnis in de Baarnse Voor het medeplegen van moord en diefstal 
werden Boudewijn Henny en Hennie Werkhoven veroordeeld tot negen jaar gevangenisstraf Zij werden daarnaast aan 
de regering ter beschikking gesteld om van overheidswege te worden verpleegd Bij de straftoemeting hield 
de rechtbank rekening met de jeugdige leeftijd jaar van het slachtoffer en de gruwelijke wijze 
waarop de moord was uitgevoerd terwijl Ewout op de uitkijk stond lokten Boudewijn en Hennie 
Mastwijk de woning uit met de smoes dat hij zich moest wassen en ze hem 
dan over de grens zouden brengen Vervolgens werd Mastwijk van achteren met een snoer gewurgd 
en daarna met een hakmes de schedel ingeslagen waarna hij met hoofd eerst de put 
in is geduwd die vervolgens meteen werd gedempt Tegenover deze feiten plaatste de rechtbank het 
gegeven dat Henny en Werkhoven ten tijde van het plegen van de moord zelf pas 
respectievelijk jaar oud waren en dat enig volwassen toezicht in de aanloop naar de moord 
geheel afwezig was De rechtbank oordeelde dat sprake was van complotdenken door het drietal dat 
door ouders of andere volwassenen mogelijk had kunnen worden doorbroken De TBS met dwangverpleging werd 
opgelegd vanwege de constatering van een gebrekkige ontwikkeling van de geestvermogens en een ziekelijke stoornis 
Ewout Henny werd wegens medeplichtigheid aan de moord en wegens het medeplegen van diefstal veroordeeld 
tot zes jaar gevangenisstraf en TBS met dwangverpleging Ook bij hem werd onder meer rekening 
gehouden met zijn jeugdige leeftijd jaar ten tijde van de moord Om voor Hennie Werkhoven 
een goede advocaat te kunnen bekostigen was een geldinzameling gehouden onder burgers van Baarn en 
Soest die circa gulden opbracht Tijdens het proces beschuldigden de verdachten over en weer elkaar 
ervan Theo Mastwijk met een hakmes de schedel te hebben ingeslagen De drie hebben twee 
derde van hun straffen uitgezeten Tijdens de detentie en daarna hebben zij alle drie met 
onder meer de hulp van de reclassering hun studies kunnen voltooien Niet alleen voor de 
broers maar ook voor mededader Hennie Werkhoven werden daartoe programma's opgesteld Het was in die 
tijd gebruikelijk dat gedetineerden tijdens de gevangenschap konden werken aan hun latere terugkeer in de 
maatschappij De ware geschiedenis van deze zaak is tot nu toe nog nooit geheel beschreven 
De enige beschikbare bronnen zijn de krantenverslagen en commentaren uit de periode dat de moord 
werd ontdekt oktober en dat het proces plaatsvond maart Daarbij wordt duidelijk wat de aanloop 
was en hoe de moord heeft plaatsgevonden Maar het is niet openbaar hoe de vijf 
weken verliepen voor de moord waarbij het viertal de broers Hennie en het slachtoffer bivakkeerden 
op de zolder van de villa Dit werd uitgebreid onderzocht in de periode van het 
voorarrest als aanloop naar het proces in maart De omvangrijke rapporten van psychiaters psychologen en 
de reclassering werden als gevolg van strikte beginselen van het strafprocesrecht tijdens de zitting niet 
aan de openbaarheid prijsgegeven Ook later zijn de betreffende dossiers nooit openbaar gemaakt Dat is 
er de oorzaak van dat een aantal creatieve auteurs hun fantasie de vrije loop gaven 
en met het verhaal aan de haal gingen In dook wel een politiefotoreconstructieboek op dat 
in handen kwam van het nieuwsprogramma EenVandaag In het boek dat eigenlijk vernietigd had moeten 
worden is te zien hoe naast politieacteurs twee van de drie daders de moord Kort 
na het proces verscheen allereerst van K Beerman pseudoniem het boekje Baarnse moord uitgeverij De 
Kennemer De schrijver had het proces niet bijgewoond en beschikte ook niet over primaire bronnen 
Hij stelde een verhaal samen uit enkele van de vele krantenverslagen aangevuld met sfeertekeningen Volgens 
krantenberichten uit die tijd werden er in korte tijd zo'n exemplaren van verkocht maar er 
kwamen ook berichten dat de vader van de broers de gehele of nog resterende oplage 
had opgekocht om deze te kunnen Daarna verscheen een drietal literaire werken waarbij de auteurs 
zich door de 'plot' van de moord hadden laten inspireren vier pubers een zich ontwikkelend 
drama cumulerend in een moord Dit resulteerde in enkele psychologische romans waarbij de auteurs ieder 
op hun eigen wijze de omringende feiten inkleurden Eerst kwam de romanschrijver Johan Fabricius die 
als journalist het proces had bijgewoond met Jongensspel Den Haag uitgeverij Leopold Van het slachtoffer 
Theo maakte hij een doortrapte schlemiel en van Hennie Werkhoven een meeloper die in het 
drama was meegesleurd door de rijke broers De jongste broer zou alles hebben bedacht en 
de oudste zou de moord hebben gepleegd Fabricius paste de beschrijvingen van de karakters navenant 
aan en beschreef de jongens zodanig dat zij makkelijk herkenbaar waren In De Volkskrant werd 
daarop dit boek flink onderuitgehaald Het grote publiek zou immers hierdoor de indruk krijgen dat 
Jongensspel de ware geschiedenis beschreef hetgeen geenszins het geval was Als tweede was het de 
auteurpsychiater Manuel van Loggem die een toneelstuk schreef naar aanleiding van de moord getiteld Jeugdproces 
Amsterdam De Bezige Bij Zo'n twintig jaar later liet Thomas Rosenboom zich door de zaak 
inspireren tot de psychologische roman Vriend van verdienste Amsterdam Querido Zijn boek kreeg de meeste 
bekendheid Het kan evenmin gezien worden als een documentaire over de zaak Rosenboom kon als 
romanschrijver ook zijn fantasie en creativiteit alle kanten op laten gaan Zo maakte hij onder 
meer de vier jongens allen twee jaar ouder dan in werkelijkheid het geval was waardoor 
zijn roman meer handelt over een groepje jonge mannen dan over een stel tieners in 
hun puberteit In het najaar van werd deze moordzaak verfilmd onder de titel met in 
de hoofdrollen Matthijs van de Sande Bakhuyzen Erik van Heijningen Derk Stenvers en Sander van 
Amsterdam Pierre Bokma en Carolien Spoor vertolken Voor de totstandkoming van deze film lieten de 
makers zich voornamelijk inspireren door de roman van Rosenboom De film is uiteraard fictie en 
regisseur Arno Dierickx stelde dat hij er met zijn scenarioschrijvers en producent een eigen verhaal 
van heeft willen maken Terecht waarschuwt hij dat het publiek nu niet moet denken de 
ware geschiedenis voorgeschoteld te krijgen In de film gaat het vooral om de vijf weken 
voorafgaande aan de moord toen het viertal gezamenlijk bivakkeerde op de zolder van de villa 
Het blad Quote vermeldde deze moordzaak in in hun jaarlijkse Quote waar de gebroeders Henny 
op de plaats staan met een geschat vermogen van miljoen euro In dezelfde villa als

In diverse landen kende men eeuwenlang een algemene verhuisdag ook wel vaste verhuisdag genoemd Vaak 
was dat op mei maar er kwamen ook andere datums voor De algemene verhuisdag was 
een direct gevolg van het feit dat contracten meestal op mei begonnen of eindigden Wisselde 
men van baas vrijwillig of noodgedwongen dan moest men meestal ook verhuizen Dat gold vroeger 
vooral voor boeren en landarbeiders En omdat ook de huren per mei konden worden opgezegd 
was er op die dag elk jaar een piek in verhuizingen de algemene De eerste 
mei als contractdatum en betaaldatum in onze streken is al heel oud De oude term 
meye of meye daghe betekende mei De Hollandse graaf verpachtte in een erf in Dordrecht 
voor schelling per jaar te betalen alle jare ene helft te sinte Baven daghe oktober 
ende die ander helft te meye Maar ook als het om andere afspraken ging hield 
men vaak mei aan als afrekendag Bij een geschil tussen kooplieden uit Stavoren en Lübeck 
in besliste de graaf dat die van Lübeck de toegebrachte schade moesten vergoeden en betalen 
op den eersten Meye dach in In verlengde de graaf de vrede tussen Holland en 
de Oostvriesen van Meye dach in ’t jahre tot Meye dach in ’t jahre Vanuit 
Holland en WestFriesland gezien lag aan de andere kant van de Zuiderzee OostFriesland Voor huurhuizen 
in de stad was er meestal niet een direct verband tussen arbeidscontract en huishuur Daarom 
werden er al vroeg regels gemaakt om huurders toch op de vaste wisseldatum uit het 
huis te krijgen In een Amsterdamse keur van staat De gene die in Huerhuysen wonen 
ende anderswaer sullen alle jaer vervaren op ter Meye avond by schellingen Hollands elcx dage 
te verbeuren; ’t en sy dat sy langer verwerven mogen aen dengenen die de huysen 
Met andere woorden wie weigerde per mei zijn huurhuis te ontruimen kreeg een boete van 
schellingen per dag tenzij met de eigenaar verlenging van het huurcontract was afgesproken Wanneer mei 
op zondag viel werd in Nederland de algemene verhuisdag een dag eerder of later gehouden 
In Amsterdam werd bovendien niet verhuisd op vrijdag zaterdag en maandag Vrijdag en maandag omdat 
het belangrijke marktdagen waren zaterdag vanwege de Joodse sjabbat Dat laatste was niet altijd vanzelfsprekend 
geweest In viel mei op zondag en de verhuisdag werd daarom gesteld op zaterdag april 
Dat was niet een gewone sjabbat het was ook Pesach het Joodse paasfeest Er was 
een kort geding nodig om de verhuisdag te verschuiven naar mei Mede onder invloed van 
de Franse Revolutie vrijheid gelijkheid broederschap was in de tussenkomst van een rechter niet meer 
nodig In werd door paus Gregorius XIII een verbeterde kalender afgekondigd Na oktober volgens keizer 
Julius Caesar was het de volgende dag oktober volgens paus Gregorius De lente zou in 
het vervolg weer op maart beginnen en Pasen Pinksteren en alle andere kerkelijke feestdagen zouden 
weer op de juiste dagen vallen Katholieke landen voerden de kalender meteen in maar protestantse 
landen voelden zich niet gebonden aan deze pauselijke kalender Voor de internationale handel waren twee 
kalenders natuurlijk lastig en Holland en Zeeland volgden al snel het voorbeeld van de katholieke 
zuidelijke Nederlanden Andere gewesten van de republiek volgden pas na Toen was het verschil tussen 
beide kalenders opgelopen tot elf dagen Na december was de volgende dag januari Wie per 
mei een jaarcontract had gesloten zou als het op de nieuwe kalender mei werd elf 
dagen kwijt zijn Een huurder zou elf dagen eerder uit zijn huis moeten een verhuurder 
zou minder dan de volle jaarhuur vangen De Friezen vonden het onbillijk om met terugwerkende 
kracht een contract te veranderen Het volgens afspraak handhaven van het volle recht en het 
volle genot vonden ze belangrijker En dus bleef de huurder dagen in zijn huis In 
een officiële publicatie van januari werd het bevestigd ‘possessie en gebruik der landen sal expireren 
op den vijfden Martij en van de huijsen soo in de Steden als ten Platten 
Lande alsmede de verhuijsinge en het vervaren van Dienstboden soo Knechten als Meijden met den 
elfden Meij en November’ Zo bleef in deze provincie mei de ingangsdatum voor het huren 
van knechten en dienstmeiden en voor verhuizingen Dit maatschappelijk gebruik werd in door de Friese 
Staten wettig verklaard Het gebruiken van twee kalenders binnen de republiek der zeven verenigde Nederlanden 
betekende dat men bij de datum moest vermelden of het oude of nieuwe stijl was 
Het gaf ook specifieke problemen Als een Friese dienstbode naar Holland wilde moest ze daar 
per mei beginnen terwijl haar oude dienstje nog tot mei doorliep Binnen Nederland viel de 
algemene verhuisdag niet overal op of mei In Scheveningen dicteerde de visserij de verhuisdag Er 
was geen vaste datum meestal viel hij ergens in juni als de hele vissersvloot aan 
wal lag In Gooi en Eemland wisselden knechten en meiden op Sint Katrijn november Daar 
had men bovendien het gebruik dat iedereen in de nacht van op november de nog 
in het veld lopende koeien mocht melken Dus werden ze zoveel mogelijk eerder op stal 
gezet Met Sint Katrijn moeten de koeien aan de lijn In Limburg verhuisde men op 
maart de dag waarop de negenjarige pachtcontracten van de boerderijen vervielen De algemene verhuisdag was 
een wereldwijd fenomeen In de en eeuw kwamen er in de steden geleidelijk meer verhuisdagen 
bij omdat er voor de huishuur behalve jaartermijnen ook half jaar kwartaal en maandtermijnen werden 
ingevoerd Maar de drukste verhuisdag bleef die op de voorjaarsdatum Het Belgische Leuven had maart 
Berlijn april en oktober Parijs april juli oktober en januari Londen had er eind eeuw 
al vier de drukste was Lady Day maart verder Midsummerday juni Michaelmasday september en Christmasday 
december Het Italiaanse Napels deed mee met mei maar Milaan verhuisde op september Sint Michielsdag 
Kopenhagen verhuisde op oktober Wenen op augustus het Spaanse Baskenland op december Lissabon op januari 
en juli betaling vooraf op november en mei Stockholm op oktober en Zwitserland verhuisde op 
april en oktober In Amerika bleef mei moving day ook nadat de Engelsen NieuwAmsterdam hadden 
omgedoopt tot New York en die gewoonte hield daar stand tot In de eeuw begonnen 
buitenlandcorrespondenten in kranten over de algemene verhuisdag daar te schrijven Het ging vaak over de 
enorme drukte op straat Parijs Het is de gewone verhuisdag voor personen van de mindere 
stand Het schouwspel maakte veeleer de indruk van een algemene volksverhuizing of emigratie Londen De 
drukte in de stad is net als bij jullie en degenen die verhuizen leven weken 
en maanden in een chaos Volgens de correspondent uit Berlijn maart verhuisde men daar gemakkelijk 
Kachels stonden vast in een huis en hoefden dus niet mee Men gebuikte op de 
vloer losse tapijten en men woonde gelijkvloers en dus hoefde men niet te rekenen met 
trappen voorhuizen binnenplaatsen enz De correspondent in New York noemde mei in een zwarte duivelse 
dag Het leek of half New York verhuisde Hij schetste de Amerikaan als iemand die 
niet aan een huis is gehecht De Amerikaan kende het Hollandse spreekwoord niet drie maal 
verhuisd staat gelijk aan eenmaal afgebrand Volgens een legende zou het gebruik om op mei 
te verhuizen door de eerste Hollandse volksplanters van de duivel zijn overgenomen In Limburg heette 
de boerenverhuisdag op de tweede donderdag na Pasen ook wel Allerduvelendag Het ligt voor de 
hand dat de eerste Nederlandse emigranten hun verhuisgewoonten meenamen Daar hadden ze de duivel niet 
voor nodig In New York moest uiterlijk op februari Rent Day de huur worden opgezegd 
zodat men drie maanden de tijd had om een nieuw onderkomen te vinden Op deze 
gewoonte werd door New York State een wettelijke regeling gebaseerd die inhield dat als er 
geen einddatum was vastgesteld in een huurcontract dit per definitie mei was In werd in 
de wet het verhogen van huren aan voorwaarden gebonden en dit leidde ertoe samen met 
het huizentekort na de Tweede Wereldoorlog dat moving day verdween In was in Frans Canada 
Quebec in de wet vastgelegd dat landheren de pachters niet van hun land mochten zetten 
voordat de sneeuw was gesmolten Als vervolg daarop werd in in het burgerlijk wetboek bepaald 
dat de pachttermijnen liepen van mei tot april Daarmee werd ook daar mei de nationale 
verhuisdag op z’n Frans ‘fête du déménagement’ feest der verhuizing De regering van Quebec besloot 
in dat het beter was om de verhuisdag naar de zomer te verschuiven Zo konden 
schoolkinderen het schooljaar afmaken en bovendien was het op mei in Canada vaak nog ruig 
weer Men koos voor juli de algemene vrije feestdag Canada day want dan hoefden de 
laagstbetaalden voor hun verhuizing geen onbetaald verlof op te nemen Op die dag verhuizen nog 
altijd honderdduizenden mensen die langs de straat een spoor van overbodige meubelstukken en lege dozen 
achterlaten Op de algemene verhuisdag kwam overal de woningnood schrijnend aan het licht In bleven 
in Berlijn gezinnen over zonder woning In schreven Deense kranten over de ellende van dakloze 
gezinnen na de verhuisdag op oktober In Nederland kwam vooral de woningnood in Friesland aan 
de orde In Sneek konden in veertien gezinnen geen andere woning vinden De armvoogdij deed 
zijn best om onderdak te verzorgen maar eind mei bivakkeerden nog tien gezinnen onder de 
blote hemel zonder uitzicht op een oplossing Na mei stonden in Friesland minstens gezinnen op 
straat De tijdelijke oplossingen waren soms bizar Heerenveen had als noodoplossing een houten loods bij 
de vuilnisbelt als tijdelijk onderkomen ingericht Hij was met manshoge schotten in woningen verdeeld waardoor 
iedereen goed kon horen wat er bij de buren gebeurde Met gevoel voor ironie had 
men deze loods Villa Zonder Zorg gedoopt In had een moeder met kinderen geen ander 
alternatief dan zelf slapen op een handkar en de kinderen eronder met als dekens oude 
zakken In zochten gezinnen in Wonseradeel tijdelijk onderdak in lege schuurtjes waar in de winter 
vlas was bewerkt de zogenoemde braakhokken In Harlingen stonden in er liefhebbers voor een bepaalde 
woning De eigenaar lootte er eerst zes man uit en liet die vervolgens om de 
woning dobbelen Gewoonlijk huurden pachtboeren alleen het land Ze waren eigenaar van het huis de 
schuur de werktuigen en het vee Als de landeigenaar de huur opzegde moest hij de 
gebouwen tegen taxatiewaarde aan zijn pachter vergoeden De inboedel en het vee nam de pachter 
op de vaste verhuisdag mee naar zijn nieuwe bedrijf Voor het land golden andere vervaldatums 
die waren afgestemd op de gunstigste periodes voor zaaien en maaien Meestal was dat Sint 
Petrus februari nieuwe stijl maart Sommige boeren wilden de zomerrogge beslist inzaaien op die dag 
voor ’s middags uur in de overtuiging dat later gezaaide zaadjes slechtere aren zouden produceren 
Voor bouwland werd de datum soms nog verder naar voren gehaald het moment in het 
najaar waarop het gewas van de oude pachter geoogst was Zodoende had de nieuwe pachter 
dan de gelegenheid op tijd een wintergewas in te zaaien Sint Petrus als pachtwisseldatum voor 
de landerijen stamt al uit de middeleeuwen Toen in de hertog van Saksen enkele Hollandse 
edelen de Bildlanden liet bedijken mochten ze dat land gebruiken of verpachten maar dan wel 
volgens de Friese gebruiken soo sich met pachtgoederen in onsen Vrieslande rechten gewoon De pacht 
van het land moest beginnen op Sint Petri dach in Cathedra want voor het tijdig 
inzaaien was mei te laat Verhuizen had voor een boer nogal wat voeten in aarde 
Het vervoeren van de huiselijke inboedel het vee en het landbouwmateriaal wagens rijtuigen ploeg eg 
etc vergde heel wat organisatie Hulp van anderen was daarbij hard nodig en in de 
loop der eeuwen waren daar gewoonten voor ontwikkeld In veel gebieden was burenhulp dan ook 
heel normaal en heel vaak waren het de toekomstige buren Zo was die hulp onderdeel 
van een effectief inburgeringsritueel De nieuwe boer moest tijdig laten weten dat hij op de 
verhuisdag zou arriveren Vroeg in de ochtend gingen de nieuwe buren op pad met paarden 
en wagens om hem op te halen Ze namen knechten en meiden mee Eerst hielpen 
die bij het opladen van de inboedel en daarna dreven ze het vee naar de 
nieuwe woonplaats Dat leverde een lange karavaan op van beladen wagens en kudden dieren Als 
de afstand tussen de oude en nieuwe woonplaats nogal groot was vertrokken de helpers al 
in de voorafgaande nacht De kasteleins van herbergen waar ze pauzeerden moesten voor de paarden 
een armvol gras geven Op de terugweg herhaalde zich dit ritueel en met elke pauze 
werd de stemming vrolijker door de vloeibare verteringen die de mannen naar binnen sloegen De 
betaling aan de herbergiers was voor rekening van de verhuizende boer en zijn reputatie in 
het nieuwe dorp werd bepaalde door de correctheid waarmee die nota’s werden betaald Als de 
nieuwe boer alles enigszins op orde had werden de helpers uitgenodigd voor een uitgebreide maaltijd 
met koffie maar vooral ook met sterke drank Een dergelijk verhuisritueel kwam in diverse Nederlandse 
streken voor met op onderdelen afwijkende gebruiken In Limburg en Brabant was de boerenverhuisdag een 
glorieus voorjaarsfestijn zoals dat in de rest van Nederland nauwelijks voorkwam Alleen in de Achterhoek 
waar de boeren op Sint Pieter februari verhuisden kende men iets van de zuidelijke feestelijkheid 
Die bestond daar vooral uit het rondgaan van de drankfles en het luidruchtig zingen van 
We gaan verhuizen wie gaat er mee Ten zuiden van de grote rivieren was het 
echt feest De jonge dochters van de toekomstige buren versierden de kar van het verhuizende 
gezin met groene slingers en papieren roosjes Onderweg zongen de jongelui verhuisliederen en eentje daarvan 
is nog in heel Nederland bekend Dat gaat naar Den Bosch toe In de teksten 
van tegenwoordig is de relatie met de verhuisdag verdwenen maar die was er vroeger wel 
degelijk Wie zal dat betalen zoete lieve Gerritje de boer die wij gaan halen zoete 
lieve meid Andere vragen die Gerritje moest beantwoorden luidden wat zullen wij daar drinken en 
wat zullen wij daar eten en die verwijzen naar de gemeenschappelijke maaltijd die de buren 
in de nieuwe woonplaats zou worden aangeboden De antwoorden waren zoet brandewijn met suiker en 
rijstepap met suiker De algemene verhuisdag is bijna overal verleden tijd In Friesland hield de 
contractdatum voor boerenarbeiders per mei wat langer stand dan de algemene verhuisdag In de jaren 
was het nog heel gewoon dat er boerenknechten werden gevraagd per mei Er werden wel 
moderne eisen gesteld zoals goed kunnende hand en machinemelken In de jaren werd mei een 
uitzondering Een laatste oude mei advertentie stond in februari in de Leeuwarder Courant een vaste

De oudGriekse magie is het geheel van magische praktijken en bijbehorende ideeën van de oude 
Grieken Die hebben hun wortels in prehistorische en preGriekse tijden en ze bewegen zich steeds 
tussen wetenschap en religie in Magie was bij de Grieken algemeen bekend kende diverse vormen 
en toepassingen maar werd vaak tevens als obscuur en verkeerd beschouwd Net als de godsdienst 
was ook Griekse magie het resultaat van assimilatie en syncretisme en stamt uit prehistorische tijden 
Invloeden en tradities uit de kopertijd en bronstijd zouden het taboe verklaren op het gebruik 
van ijzeren messen bij rituelen Dat tovenaressen als Circe en Medea negatief werden voorgesteld en 
magiërs met een schuin oog werden aangekeken kan verklaard worden uit de conflicten die ontstaan 
bij het botsen en gestaag versmelten van twee culturen Dat zou bijvoorbeeld betekenen dat Medea's 
kennis van magische ingrediënten teruggaat op preHelleense priestertraining of het gaat om een preGriekse Daar 
komt bij dat de Grieken de oorsprong van magie en heksen buiten Griekenland legden Zij 
zou haar oorsprong hebben in het oude Perzië en aldaar zijn uitgevonden door Het Griekse 
woord voor 'magiër' magos is dan ook van Perzische afkomst Heksen zouden afkomstig zijn uit 
Thessalië of kustgebieden langs de Zwarte Zee toentertijd het einde van de beschaafde Zoals men 
later ook in middeleeuwse magische recepten zal zien rekent men reeds in de klassieke oudheid 
in de eerste plaats magische kruiden tot het repertoire van heksen samen met toverspreuken Latijn 
carmina en in mindere mate stenen Soms tevens allerlei menselijke en dierlijke materialen zoals vers 
bloed een tong of botten Het benutten van dergelijke organische materialen is niet vreemd aangezien 
sommige dieren in de oudheid bepaalde bijzondere eigenschappen toegedicht kregen Zo baseert Plinius de Oudere 
zich op veel en op oudere bronnen bij zijn Naturalis historia waarin hij het wonderbaarlijke 
vermogen van urine van de lynx beschrijft Magie kende men in verschillende vormen en wordt 
al in een vroeg stadium in de Griekse literatuur beschreven Zo kende men het dodenorakel 
verbonden aan de algemeen verbreide overtuiging dat de doden als schimmen voortleefden en de toekomst 
konden voorspellen zoals voorkomt in Homerus' Veelvoorkomend is de zogeheten bindingsspreuk Latijn defixiones die een 
godheid aanriepen voor een bepaalde persoon Vaak werden bindingsspreuken gebruikt in noodgevallen bijvoorbeeld voor het 
winnen van een wedstrijd of rechtszaak bij ambachtsconcurrentie of een vete Ook kende magie een 
agrarische dimensie spreuken konden ingezet worden om oogst en gewassen van een veld naar een 
ander te verplaatsen Verder kende men nog liefdesmagie en magie in de vorm van genezingsrituelen 
Gedurende de Romeinse keizertijd werden bepaalde rituelen binnen de waarzeggerij ook geassocieerd met De Grieken 
kenden de vormen van voorspelling onder de term mantike Een god of bovennatuurlijk wezen wordt 
door middel van gebeden of spreuken gevraagd om tussenbeide te komen ten behoeve van de 
persoon die het gebed uit Een theoretisch verschil is voor sommigen echter zijn dat een 
gebed van een gelovige gericht is aan een godheid met een onafhankelijke wil die al 
dan niet het verzoek kan inwilligen terwijl dit bij magie anders is Een dergelijk onderscheid 
treft men bijvoorbeeld bij de Romein Lucanus eerste eeuw aan In de Codex Theodosianus vele 
wetteksten verzameld door een commissie in opdracht van Theodosius II werd het raadplegen van een 
magiër verboden en kregen magiebeoefenaars de doodstraf opgelegd Keizer Augustus vChr nChr toonde een dubbele 
houding ten aanzien van magie Hij liet enerzijds grote hoeveelheden toverboeken verbranden anderzijds was hij 
tevreden over de voorspellingen van zijn eigen magiërs Keizer Claudius liet de magiërs verbannen tenzij 
ze op het keizerlijk hof bleven De reden voor het vijandig beleid is dat magische 
teksten potentieel crimineel of staatsgevaarlijk Paradoxaal genoeg was er in met name de eerste eeuw 
na Christus een duidelijke markt voor magie zoals blijkt uit het werk van Tacitus Seneca 
de tragedies Medea en Oedipus en Lucanus Dat neemt evenwel niet weg dat in veel 
gevallen er een bepaalde vorm van magie als 'verkeerd' tegenover een bepaalde vorm van magie 
als 'juist' geplaatst wordt Zo beschouwt Lucanus in zijn Pharsalia het dodenorakel en 'gerommel' met 
geesten en lijken als misdadig terwijl erkende vormen van waarzeggerij en orakels zoals het befaamde 
Orakel van Delphi dat duidelijk niet zijn Het verschil zit hem erin dat bij laatstgenoemden 
de goden niet gedwongen worden maar nederig verzocht worden terwijl 'hekserij' de goden verplicht tot 
particuliere Belangrijk voor de latere ontwikkeling van magie in het westen is het feit dat 
magie vanaf de tweede eeuw mengt met filosofie terwijl filosofie weer richting religie beweegt en 
Dat is te zien bij het hermetisme neopythagorisme en neoplatonisme bijvoorbeeld onder invloed van Plotinus 
en Jamblichus ca ca Hun neoplatonische kosmologie waarin de kosmos werd voorgesteld als één groot 
harmonieus verbonden geheel werd daarbij verbonden met uitgewerkte rituelen om goden aan te roepen en 
in te zetten om de eigen magische krachten te Dit noemt men theürgie waarvan de 
vroegste bron de Chaldeïsche Orakelen zijn tweede eeuw Tegelijkertijd groeide echter ook de associatie van 
magie met demonische krachten Kerkvaders zoals Augustinus hadden vanzelfsprekend moeite met theürgie maar werden toch 
geïnspireerd door het neoplatonische Verwijzingen naar magie kunnen verder nog gevonden worden in De Staat 
van Plato over de Ring van Gyges De gouden ezel van Apuleius en de De 
vitae caesarum van Suetonius Augustus Een van de Idyllen van Theokritos eerste helft derde eeuw 
vChr staat ook geheel in het teken van magie het betreft liefdesmagie ingezet door een 
wanhopige Simaitha om een man die zij bemint Dalfis voor zich te winnen Daarbij wordt

Een zwarte zaterdag in het verkeer is een uitdrukking om extreme drukte in het Europese 
autoverkeer aan te duiden als gevolg van een massale vakantieuittocht De zwarte zaterdagen vallen meestal 
in het laatste weekend van juli enof het eerste weekend van augustus als veel Fransen 
vooral uit Parijs op vakantie gaan Op veel vakantieparken in ZuidFrankrijk kan een huisje in 
het hoogseizoen alleen gehuurd worden van zaterdag tot zaterdag De toeristen moeten dus wel op 
zaterdag reizen Met name de Autoroute du Soleil en de autosnelweg naar het zuidoosten van 
Frankrijk en het oosten van Spanje krijgt op die dag veel verkeer te verwerken In 
stond er meer dan km file op de Franse wegen In waren er twee zwarte 
zaterdagen in Frankrijk zowel de laatste zaterdag van juli als de eerste van augustus In 
stond er op augustus op het drukste moment van de dag in totaal km file 
op de Franse Tevens is het zo dat de Franse verkeerswebsite Bison Futé de zwarte 
kleur gebruikt om de dagen aan te duiden waarop het verkeer extrêment dense extreem druk 
Voorheen was het begrip zwarte zaterdag voor het verkeer slechts bekend in de Nederlandse taal 
Fransen spreken van les jours de grands départs = dagen van de grote uittocht maar 
sinds enkele jaren is samedi noir ook in de Franse taal ingeburgerd dankzij de kleurcodering 
van Bison Door de Nederlandse pers worden gaandeweg ook andere zaterdagen met extreme verkeersdrukte als 
gevolg van vakantieverkeer bijvoorbeeld die op de eerste zaterdag van de wintersportvakantie in Duitsland en 
Oostenrijk aangeduid als zwarte zaterdag In België wordt de eerste zaterdag van de Paasvakantie ook 
vaak aangeduid als zwarte zaterdag Een dag waarop de files minder ernstig zijn wordt wel 
rood genoemd bijvoorbeeld vendredi rouge De classificatie zwarte zaterdag verwijst ook naar het busongeval in 
Beaune het ernstigste verkeersongeluk uit de Franse geschiedenis In de vroege ochtend van juli tijdens 
vakantiedrukte en regenval reed bij Beaune een bus op enkele personenauto's in Als gevolg van 
de crash en de brand die daarop uitbrak kwamen mensen om onder wie kinderen tussen 
Kenneth Erwin Hagin McKinney Texas augustus Tulsa Oklahoma september was een Amerikaanse prediker uit de 
pinksterbeweging Hij wordt gezien als de ‘geestelijk’ vader van de Woord van Geloofbeweging Door zijn 
volgelingen wordt hij vaak aangeduid als 'papa' Hagin Volgens Hagins eigen getuigenis leed hij als 
kind aan een vervormd hart en zou hij een bloedziekte hebben Hij was tot zijn 
vijftiende levensjaar bedlegerig Op april onderging hij zijn bekeringservaring Hij is in een tijdsbestek van 
tien minuten driemaal gestorven uit zijn lichaam getreden en zag iedere keer de poort van 
de hel maar kwam steeds weer tot leven De derde keer vroeg hij om vergeving 
van zijn zonden Hagin claimt ook dat hij in door een openbaring van God opstond 
van het sterfbed Twee jaar later hield hij zijn eerste preek in een kleine kerk 
bij hem in de buurt In de twaalf jaar die daarop volgde zou hij in 
Texas aan vijf kerken van de Assemblies of God leiding geven In begon hij zijn 
eigen bediening als Bijbelleraar en evangelist In die tijd was hij ook lid van de 
Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International en van de Voice of Healingrevival met oa Oral 
Roberts en Thomas Lee Osborn In richtte hij de Kenneth E Hagin Evangelistic Association op 
en het kantoor werd gevestigd in Tulsa Oklahoma In begon hij zijn eigen radioprogramma Faith 
Seminar of the Air Vandaag de dag heeft de organisatie een eigen drukkerij met miljoen 
drukken per jaar een televisieprogramma op Trinity Broadcasting Network een magazine met een oplage van 
een eigen Bijbelschool een healing center en worden er jaarlijks verschillende evangelisatiecampagnes georganiseerd Hagin wordt 
door zijn volgelingen gezien als een dynamisch prediker en een profeet Hij spreekt met name 
over gebedsgenezing en hangt de zogeheten voorspoedleer aan Zijn Bijbeluitleg focust zich op het belang 
van geloof en het overwinningsleven van een christen Zijn favoriete Bijbeltekst is Marcus Ik verzeker 
jullie als iemand tegen die berg zegt “Kom van je plaats en stort je in 
zee” en niet twijfelt in zijn hart maar gelooft dat gebeuren zal wat hij zegt 
dan zal het ook gebeuren” Critici van Hagin onder wie een groot aantal christenen afkomstig 
uit de charismatische beweging zien zijn uitspraken als sektarisch en niet in overeenstemming met de 
leer van de christelijke In brachten twee studenten van de Oral Roberts University aan het 
licht dat Hagin veel van zijn theologie letterlijk heeft overgenomen uit de boeken van andere 
auteurs Zo kwam aan het licht dat Hagin plagiaat had gepleegd door woord voor woord 
teksten te kopiëren uit de boeken van de evangelist E W Kenyon Hagin verwierp de 
aantijgingen met het argument dat het niet zo gek was dat hij letterlijk dingen zou 
hebben overgenomen want als mensen namens God over hetzelfde onderwerp spreken "dan is het niet 
raar dat God hun dezelfde woorden ingeeft want het is dezelfde Geest die hen leidt 
Cherish is een nummer van Madonna de derde single van haar album Like a Prayer 
Na de controversiële singles Like a Prayer en Express Yourself kwam Madonna met de single 
Cherish een romantisch liefdesliedje Aanvankelijk wilde Madonna het niet toevoegen aan het album omdat ze 
het "te vrolijk" vond in vergelijking met de rest van het album Het nummer werd 
wereldwijd een grote hit maar bereikte in Nederland een vijftiende plaats in de hitlijsten Als 
Bkant van de single werd het niet eerder verschenen nummer "Supernatural" uitgebracht De enige liveuitvoeringen 
van Cherish waren op de Blond Ambition Tour van Hierin speelde playbackte Madonna op een 
harp en zong ze het nummer terwijl er drie zeemeermannen op het podium lagen De 
videoclip van Cherish werd geregisseerd door topfotograaf Herb Ritts Cherish is de eerste muziekvideo die 
hij regisseerde Het is een zwartwitclip waarin onder andere Madonna's toenmalige vriend Tony Ward figureert

Tol was een neef leerling en navolger van Gerrit Dou en wordt gerekend tot de 
kring van de Leidse fijnschilders Hij werkte in de stijl en thematiek van zijn leermeester 
en kopieerde een aantal van diens werken Elementen uit werk van Dou en andere Leidse 
fijnschilders integreerde hij in zijn eigen werken zoals het afbeelden van figuren onder een nisvormige 
stenen boog en het toepassen van de clairobscurtechniek Hij was hierin zo bedreven dat zijn 
werk soms werd verward met dat van Dou Zijn techniek werd zelfs als zodanig gekenschetst 
dat zijn werk door sommigen zelfs hoger werd aangeslagen dan dat van de uiterst precies 
werkende Van Tol was in Leiden werkzaam vanaf omstreeks het jaar waarin hij zich inschreef 
bij het plaatselijke SintLucasgilde In ging hij in ondertrouw met de Leidse Maria Pollion waarna 
het paar verhuisde naar Utrecht Van tot verbleven zij in Amsterdam en kregen een zoon

Tien teams schreven zich in voor de kwalificatie van het wereldkampioenschap voetbal de OFC heeft 
geen vaste plaats op het WK maar moest nog een intercontinentale eindronde spelen met een 
team van de CONMEBOL In totaal deden teams mee aan dit kwalificatietoernooi Van alle leden 
van de OFC deden alleen PapoeaNieuwGuinea en NieuwCaledonië niet mee De overige landen namen wel 
deel Het was vooraf niet zeker of een van deze landen zich ook zou plaatsen 
De OFC heeft plek wat betekent dat dat er aan het eind nog een wedstrijd 
tegen een land uit een ander continent gespeeld moet worden Geen enkel land zou zich 
uiteindelijk plaatsen In de eerste wedstrijd verbeterde Australië het wereldrecord overwinningen in internationale wedstrijden het 
won met van Tonga Twee dagen later werd dat record weer vebeterd na een overwinning 
op AmerikaansSamoa Van de senioren spelers in het team van AmerikaansSamoa speelde alleen doelman Nicky 
Salapu de andere spelers konden Australië niet binnen komen vanwege paspoortproblemen de spelers van het 
jeugdteam waren niet beschikbaar vanwege examens Daarom stond een team in het veld van gemiddeld 
jaar drie spelers waren jaar oud Ook Australië stelde niet hun sterkste spelers op hetgeen 
de recordzege het was tevens de hoogste uitslag in een wedstrijd ooit nog opmerkelijker maakte 
Archie Thompson scoorde in die wedstrijd goals tevens een wereldrecord David Zdrilić scoorde acht treffers 
het eena hoogste aantal treffers in één wedstrijd Er werd zoveel gescoord dat het scoreboord 
de tel kwijt was het gaf een eindstand aan van na bestudering van de rapporten 
werd de uitslag gecorrigeerd naar Australië zag wel de nutteloosheid in van dit soort wedstrijden 
het riep op om voorrondewedstrijden in de kwalificatie van de Oceaniëgroepen in te voeren tussen 
de zwakke landen en besloot in toe te treden tot de Aziatische Zone Australië plaatste 
zich voor de finalepoule met een doelsaldo van voor en nul tegen in vier wedstrijden 
tegenstander was Nieuw Zeeland dat aanzienlijker minder scoorde tegen vergelijkbare tegenstanders doelpunten Net als de 
vorige twee kwalificatieronden had Australië geen problemen de "Kiwi's" te verslaan in Auckland in Sydney 
De bij Feyenoord Rotterdam voetballende middenvelder Brett Emerton scoorde in deze twee wedstrijden drie doelpunten

gewervelde dieren In de brede zin van het woord omvat het alle dierlijke en soms 
menselijke weefsels inclusief organen zoals lever of nieren In de engste zin slaat de term 
uitsluitend op het spierweefsel van zoogdieren die gekweekt zijn voor consumptie door de mens Het 
merendeel van het vlees dat geconsumeerd wordt is afkomstig van dieren uit de bioindustrie slachtvlees 
Eén van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van vlees is kweekvlees In de kookkunst 
en in wetenschappelijk onderzoek voor wat betreft de gezondheidseffecten van vlees wordt vlees regelmatig ingedeeld 
in vier De kleur van vlees wordt deels bepaald door de oxidatietoestand van het ijzeratoom 
in myoglobine en de zuurstofatomen die eraan verbonden zijn Wanneer vlees nog in de rauwe 
toestand is is het ijzeratoom in de oxidatietoestand en gebonden aan dizuurstof daardoor ontstaat roodachtig 
oxymyoglobine waardoor myoglobinerijk vlees er rood uitziet Vlees dat gaargekookt is neemt een grauwe tot 
grauwbruine kleur aan door de vorming van metmyoglobine dat bij verhitting ontstaat denaturatie Daarbij bevindt 
het ijzeratoom zich nu in de oxidatietoestand het heeft een elektron verloren en heeft nu 
een watermolecule bij zich Onder bepaalde omstandigheden kan vlees roze blijven gedurende verhitting hoewel het 
aan hoge temperaturen wordt blootgesteld Wanneer rauw vlees aan nitriet wordt blootgesteld zal het vlees 
roze blijven omdat het ijzeratoom dan gebonden is aan NO stikstofmonoxide Onder meer cornedbeef en 
de meeste ham worden behandeld met kaliumnitriet of natriumnitriet Bij vleeswaren die verpakt worden in 
een atmosfeer met koolmonoxide bindt het ijzermolecule aan koolmonoxide waardoor metmyoglobine wordt gevormd Het oppervlak 
van deze vleeswaren blijft dan roze wat in de ogen van de consument met "vers" 
wordt geassocieerd Deze kunstmatig veroorzaakte rode kleur kan echter zeer lang in het vlees aanwezig 
blijven tot wel een jaar De hoeveelheid en typen spiervezels kunnen tussen verschillende dieren uiteenlopen 
Daardoor is de roodheid van vlees sterk afhankelijk van diersoort leeftijd van het dier en 
de hoeveelheid beweging die het dier heeft gehad De Nederlandse huishoudens consumeren jaarlijks miljoen kilo 
varkensvlees voor een waarde van miljoen euro Per hoofd van de bevolking werd in vlees 
per jaar gebruikt rund kalf varken kip kalkoen Omdat in dat gemiddelde ook vegetariërs en 
miljoen parttimevegetariërs zitten zal de doorsnee vleesconsument meer gebruiken Daarnaast worden eieren per jaar per 
hoofd van de bevolking Méér dan driekwart van het in Nederland geproduceerde vlees wordt geëxporteerd 
In werd voor bijna miljard gulden aan vlees en vleesproducten en voor miljard gulden aan 
zuivelproducten Tegelijk werd in voor miljard gulden aan veehouderijproducten geïmporteerd Er zijn anno tegengestelde tendensen 
waar te nemen in de prijsstelling van vlees Aan de ene kant proberen Nederlandse supermarkten 
klanten te lokken met goedkoop vlees kip eurokg en aan de andere kant verkopen sommige 
supermarkten biologisch vlees kip eurokg dat ruim een factor duurder is De prijzen van eieren 
variëren van tot euro per stuk dat is een factor prijsverschil Rond nam de vleesconsumptie 
van varkensvlees en koeienvlees ieder jaar gestaag Maar bleef sinds ongeveer Er bestaat kritiek op 
de manier hoe dieren gehouden worden en of ze wel geëxploiteerd mogen worden In Nederland 
voerde Stichting Wakker Dier actie tegen vlees waarvoor biggen worden gecastreerd kalveren bloedarmoede krijgen blank 
kalfsvlees het prijsstunten met vlees kiloknaller en kippen die uit economische overwegingen te snel moeten 
groeien plofkippen De vleesproductie is verantwoordelijk voor en mogelijk meer van de antropogene broeikasgasemissies in 
de Koeien bijvoorbeeld produceren ongeveer miljoen kubieke meter methaan per dag dat is zo'n tot 
van de totale methaanuitstoot van de Vee is verantwoordelijk voor van alle menselijke emissies van 
het krachtige en langlevende broeikasgas Er is overtuigend bewijs dat regelmatige consumptie van rood vlees 
bijvoorbeeld rund varkens en lamsvlees en verwerkt vlees bijvoorbeeld ham en salami het risico op 
colonkanker sterk verhoogt Het World Cancer Research Fund heeft studies op dit gebied bekeken daarvan 
bevatten volgens de onderzoekers het doorslaggevende bewijs dat rood en verwerkt vlees in grotere hoeveelheden 
gevaarlijk kan zijn Om deze reden beveelt het WCRF aan dat mensen niet meer dan 
rood vlees gegaard gewicht dit staat gelijk aan rauw per week eten en verwerkt vlees 
helemaal Vleesconsumptie in zijn algemeenheid maar vooral de consumptie van rood vlees hangt eveneens samen 
met een verhoogd risico op en Een belangrijke kankerpromotor in rood vlees is waarschijnlijk het 
heemijzer Rood vlees wordt daarnaast ook in verband gebracht met een hoger totaal overlijdensrisico en 
een hoger risico om te sterven aan hart en Wit vlees zoals dat van gevogelte 
wordt daarentegen juist in verband gebracht met een lager totaal overlijdensrisico en een kleinere kans 
om aan hart en vaatziekten of kanker te In een grootschalig epidemiologisch onderzoek bleek de 
consumptie van verwerkt vlees ook geassocieerd met een verhoogd risico op beroerte bij Eerder bleek 
een dergelijk verband ook al bij Echter in een grote studie de EPIC studie onder 
meer dan mensen geschikt voor analyse in Europa waar aan ook het Nederlandse RIVM heeft 
meegewerkt bleek er in eerste instantie een verhoogd risico te zijn op het totaal overlijdensrisico 
bij rood vlees gebruikers maar bleef dit na correctie voor bewerkt vlees en meetfouten niet 
meer overeind Uiteindelijk bleek alleen de relatie tussen het totale overlijdensrisico en bewerkt vlees significant 
Het ging hier om een hazardratio van per gramdag bij een mediane followup duur van 
jaar De onderzoekers schatten dat van de sterfte voorkomen kan worden als alle deelnemers aan 
de studie minder dan gram bewerkt vlees per dag zouden Het ging dan vooral om 
sterfte door hart en vaatziekten en in mindere mate om kanker Opvallend was dat de 
totale sterfte hoger was bij de mensen die weinig tot geen rood vlees consumeerden Ook 
hier werd geen verband gevonden tussen de consumptie van gevogelte en de totale sterfte De 
consumptie van vlees wordt sterk bepaald door de cultuur Afhankelijk daarvan worden sommige dieren niet 
gegeten Typische voorbeelden zijn honden en katten die niet gegeten worden in westerse culturen maar 
wel in bijvoorbeeld China Varkensvlees wordt door sommige culturen en religies als onrein beschouwd Het 
eten van mensenvlees kannibalisme wordt vrijwel overal als een taboe gezien Mensen die er om 
culturele of principiële redenen voor kiezen om geen vlees en vis te eten noemt men 
vegetariërs Vlees wordt ook overdrachtelijk gebruikt voor het menselijk of dierlijk lichaam of delen van

Frederik Hansen Sødring Aalborg mei Hellerup april was een Deens kunstschilder Hij schilderde voornamelijk landschappen 
in een door de romantiek beïnvloede stijl Sødring was de zoon van een koopman Hij 
woonde tijdens zijn jeugd een tijdlang met zijn ouders in Noorwegen en studeerde daarna aan 
de Koninklijke Deense Kunstacademie onder Jens Peter Møller maar hij werd met name beïnvloed door 
de landschapsschilder Johan Christian Clausen Dahl Tussen en reisde hij door Noorwegen ZuidDuitsland waar hij 
korte tijd studeerde in München en Tirol De bergachtige omgevingen in die landen maakte grote 
indruk op hem en waren bepalend voor de thema's die in zijn verdere carrière zou 
schilderen Qua stijl wordt hij gerekend tot de landschapsromantiek In huwde Sødring Henriette Marie de 
Bang de dochter van een grootgrondbezitter waardoor hij financieel onafhankelijk werd Toen hij in op 
leeftijd overleed liet hij een groot bedrag na aan de Deense Kunstacademie en werd er

Het Aartsbisdom Salzburg Latijn Archidioecesis Salisburgensis is een aartsbisdom in Oostenrijk Het aartsbisdom omvat de 
deelstaat Salzburg en het noordoosten van Tirol De aartsbisschop van Salzburg is de Metropoliet van 
de kerkprovincie Salzburg waar behalve het Aartsbisdom Salzburg ook de volgende bisdommen toe behoren Bij 
de organisatie van de Beierse Kerk stichtte Bonifatius in het bisdom Salzburg Karel de Grote 
liet het bisdom in tot aartsbisdom verheffen In werd de rivier de Drau Drave aangewezen 
als grens van de kerkprovincie met het patriarchaat Aquileja De aartsbisschop voerde de volgende eretitels 
Tot de kerkprovincie Salzburg behoorden de bisdommen In werd de aartsbisschop van Salzburg heerser over 
een wereldlijk gebied dat bekendstaat als het Prinsaartsbisdom Salzburg In werd het bisdom Wenen verheven 
tot aartsbisdom waardoor Wenen en Wiener Neustadt losgemaakt werden van de kerkprovincie Salzburg Vervolgens werd 
het bisdom Passau in exemt waardoor het ook losgemaakt werd van Salzburg Dit was het 
grootste verlies sinds voor de kerkprovincie In kregen alle Oostenrijkse gebieden een nieuwe kerkelijke indeling 
waarbij de kerkelijke grenzen zo veel mogelijk samen vielen met de politieke grenzen De zetel 
van Gurk werd verlegd naar Klagenfurt de hoofdstad van Karinthië en die van Seckau naar 
Graz de hoofdstad van Stiermarken Nieuw gesticht werd het bisdom Leoben De nieuwe kerkelijke indeling 
van Beieren in beperkte de kerkprovincie tot Oostenrijks staatsgebied Freising behoorde voortaan tot het aartsbisdom 
MünchenFreising De gebieden van de Duitse bisdommen Augsburg en Konstanz binnen Oostenrijk kwamen bij Salzburg 
In werd de kerkprovincie uitgebreid met het bisdom Trentino in ZuidTirol Dit bisdom stond tot 
dan direct onder de paus Na de Eerste Wereldoorlog verloor Oostenrijk veel gebied en dus 
ook de daarin gelegen bisdommen Trentino en Brixen gingen aan Italië verloren en Lavant aan

De Grevelingensluis is de schutsluis bij Bruinisse De sluis verbindt het Grevelingenmeer met de Krammer 
CEMTklasse Va Voor de bouw van een tweede brug een rolbrug over de sluis is 
een bouwvergunning afgegeven De sluis is m lang waarvan bij vloed maar m kan worden 
gebruikt Het verschil wordt veroorzaakt door de brug die over de m brede kolk ligt 
en waaronder bij vloed geen schip mag Het ontstaan van de sluis is een gevolg 
van de aanleg van de Grevelingendam In de dam was een schutsluis voor de scheepvaart 
nodig De bouw werd in april aanbesteed en op juni werd de sluis voor het 
scheepvaartverkeer In is er op het terrein van de Grevelingensluis een ringweg voor wegverkeer opengesteld 
Het Pianoconcert nr in G majeur opus is een compositie van de Russische componist Pjotr 
Iljitsj Tsjaikovski geschreven in en Het concert bestaat uit drie delen In beleefde Tsjaikovski's eerste 
pianoconcert een enorme populariteit Nikolaj Rubinstein had bij dit werk een aantal verbeteringen aangegeven na 
het werk te hebben bestudeerd en een aantal keren te hebben voorgedragen Vooral de voordrachten 
droegen bij aan de populariteit Tsjaikovski voelde zich door de immense populariteit van zijn pianoconcert 
in bes mineur genoodzaakt een nieuw pianoconcert te schrijven Hij begon hiermee in oktober toen 
hij verbleef bij zijn zuster te Kamenka Hier schreef hij zijn patrones en hartsvriendin Nadjezda 
von Meck; Ik wil dit concert opdragen aan NG Rubinstein ter waardering voor zijn magnifieke 
spel in het eerste pianoconcert en mijn sonate Hij liet mij in absolute vervoering nadat 
hij het voor mij speelde in Moskou Het componeren ging Tsjaikovski vlug af Maart voltooide 
hij het werk en bracht de orkestratie aan Tsjaikovski zat echter nog met Rubinsteins reactie 
op het werk Hij schreef Von Meck; Ik huiver van de gedachte dat ik misschien 
weer kritiek van Nikolaj Grigorjevitsj aan wie ik dit concert heb opgedragen krijg Desalniettemin zelfs 
als hij het concert bekritiseert maar het dan wel zo briljant opvoert als het eerste 
concert zal die kritiek mij niet uitmaken Ondertussen ben ik zelf erg tevreden met het 
concert maar wat in de toekomst ligt dat kan ik niet zeggen Tsjaikovski had zich 
nergens zorgen over moeten maken Rubinsteins reactie was deze keer voorzichtig Hij suggereerde dat het 
sologedeelte té episodisch was té veel verwikkeld in een dialoog met het orkest dan aanwezig 
op de voorgrond Hier voegde hij aan toe; nu ik dit alles zeg nauwelijks nog 
wat van het concert te hebben gespeeld zit ik misschien verkeerd Tsjaikovski deed Rubinsteins commentaar 
van de hand overigens zonder enige rancune In maart overleed Rubinstein Tsjaikovski vluchtte naar Parijs 
om zijn begrafenis bij te wonen Het concert beleefde zijn première op november te New 
York met het New York Philharmonic en Madeline Schiller als soliste In mei werd de 
Russische première gehouden te Moskou Anton Rubinstein dirigeerde met Tsjaikovski's leerling Sergej Tanejev als solist 
Het tweede pianoconcert werd in tegenstelling tot zijn voorganger goed door het publiek opgenomen Critici 
vielen echter over een paar kleinigheden; het Allegro brillante e molto vivace en het Andante 
non troppo waren té lang en het hoofdthema was té verwarrend en bevatte te veel 
solistische cadensen De pianist Aleksander Ziloti bewerkte om deze twee aanmerkingen het concert lichtelijk Hij 
verkortte het eerste deel met maten en het tweede deel met maten Meer verbaasd werd 
gereageerd op het feit dat in het Andante non troppo een grote solistische rol was 
weggelegd voor de viool en de cello De piano zou uit zijn functie zijn getreden 
door deze twee solisten te veel te begeleiden Het concert begint met een trots thema 
voor het orkest dat met grootse akkoorden door de piano wordt overgenomen Een warm tweede 
thema door de klarinet ingezet wordt overgenomen door de piano Een korte cadenza wordt ingezet 
waarna een grootse cadenza wordt ingezet Deze wordt weer overgenomen door het hoofdthema Een herhaling 
uitgevoerd door het orkest volgt waarbij een briljant coda het Allegro brillante e molto vivace 
afsluit Het Andante non troppo opent met een vier minuten durende solo voor de viool 
en cello De lieflijke melodie wordt overgenomen door de piano na de vier minuten De 
sfeer straalt schoonheid en sereniteit uit Spanning ontwikkelt zich in het midden met een lange 
passage voor het orkest De cello en viool keren terug waarna hetzij nu de piano 
begeleidend Het Allegro con fuoco opent met de piano die een uitbundig thema speelt De 
opklimmende akkoorden worden vervolgd met dalende akkoorden De piano levert een lyrische variatie welke een 
blije sfeer om zich heeft Vooral deze finale laat zien hoe inventief Tsjaikovski om kon

EPrime Bourland afkorting voor English Prime heeft oorspronkelijk betrekking op een modificatie van de Engelse 
taal die het gebruik van alle vormen van het werkwoord “zijn” verbiedt maar is evenzeer 
van toepassing op vrijwel elke andere taal dus ook het Nederlands D David Bourland Jr 
stelde een aantal jaren na de dood van Korzybski in EPrime voor als toevoeging aan 
Afred Korzybski's algemene semantiek Bourland die bij Korzybski studeerde bedacht de term in een essay 
uit met de titel A Linguistic Note Writing in EPrime oorspronkelijk gepubliceerd in het General 
Semantics Bulletin Het riep al snel een controverse op binnen de algemene semantiek deels omdat 
beoefenaars van de Algemene Semantiek vonden dat Bourland het werkwoord ‘zijn’ als zodanig aanviel en 
niet bepaalde manieren waarop het gebruikt werd Korzybski had gezien dat de twee vormen van 
het werkwoord ‘zijn’— het 'is' van identiteit en het bewerende ‘is' — structurele problemen opleverden 
Bijvoorbeeld de zin “De jas is rood” heeft geen waarnemer de zin “We zien de 
jas als rood” waar “we” de waarnemers aangeeft lijkt juister dan de feiten over lichtgolven 
en kleur zoals ze door de moderne wetenschap weergegeven worden dat wil zeggen dat kleur 
het resultaat is van een reactie in het menselijk brein Korzybski bepleitte het verhogen van 
iemands bewustzijn doorgaans door het trainen in algemene semantiek In het gebruik heeft het werkwoord 
‘zijn’ duidelijk verschillende functies Bourland ziet met name de functies van “identiteit” en “bewering” als 
verderfelijk maar bepleit het elimineren van alle vormen ten bate van de eenvoud In het 
geval van de “bestaans”vorm en minder idiomatisch de “plaats”vorm kan men het eenvoudig vervangen door 
“bestaat” EPrime dwingt de schrijver werkwoorden en betekenissen zorgvuldig te kiezen het elimineren van “zijn” 
elimineert impliciet de passieve stem en het progressieve aspect Alleen al deze beperking is verantwoordelijk 
voor een groot deel van de aantrekkingskracht van EPrime voor sommigen van de pleitbezorgers ervan 
aangezien vele stilisten betogen dat zulke constructies maar al te vaak in slordig geschreven Engels 
voorkomen Natuurlijk kan het voor sommige schrijvers ook problemen opleveren als ze EPrime leren gebruiken 
Bourland en andere pleitbezorgers opperen ook dat het gebruik van EPrime tot een minder dogmatische 
taalstijl leidt en dat de mogelijkheid tot misverstand en conflict kleiner wordt Zie bijvoorbeeld hieronder 
bij Links het artikel van Bourland over grondslagen van EPrime Kwaadsprekers zouden kunnen opmerken dat 
sommige talen equivalenten van het werkwoord “zijn” nu al heel verschillend hanteren zonder dat ze 
de sprekers duidelijke voordelen bieden Het Arabisch mist net als het Russisch bijvoorbeeld al een 
werkwoordsvorm van “zijn” in de tegenwoordige tijd Als iemand in het Arabisch wil beweren dat 
een appel er rood uitziet zal hij niet letterlijk zeggen “de appel is rood” maar 
“de appel roodt” Sprekers kunnen met andere woorden zelfs zonder het bestaan van het woord 
zelf toch de werkwoordsvorm van “zijn” communiceren met de semantische voor en nadelen daarvan Voor 
hen biedt de poging tot het afzwakken van de dubbelzinnigheden door Eprime dus geen oplossing 
Op dezelfde manier maakt de taal van de Ainu consequent geen onderscheid tussen “zijn” en 
“worden”; dus ne betekent voor hen zowel “zijn” als “worden” en pirka betekent zowel “goed” 
“wees goed” als “wordt goed” Veel talen — bijvoorbeeld Japans Spaans en Hebreeuws — maken 
al het onderscheid tussen “bestaanplaats” en “identiteitbewering” EPrime en Charles Kay Ogdens Basic English zijn 
niet met elkaar verenigbaar omdat Basic English een gesloten verzameling werkwoorden heeft die werkwoorden zoals 
“worden” “blijven” en “gelijk” uitsluiten die EPrime gebruikt om op een nauwkeurige manier toestanden van 
het zijn te beschrijven Wijzigingen zoals die voor EPrime zijn voorgesteld zouden ook zoveel manieren 
elimineren om het aspect in het AfroAmerikaanse moederEngels uit te drukken dat het onwerkbaar zou 
blijken te zijn als het in het wilde weg in zo’n taal toegepast zou worden 
Alfred Korzybski heeft kritiek uitgeoefend op het gebruik van het werkwoord “zijn” en van hem 
wordt de uitspraak aangehaald dat “elke stelling die het woord ‘is’ bevat of het daaraan 
verwante ‘zijn’ ‘was’ enz een linguïstische structuur creëert die uiteindelijk ernstige misvattingen oplevert” Maar hij 
zei ook dat de door hem bedachte uitspraak “de kaart is niet het gebied” gerechtvaardigd 
was omdat “de ontkenning van de identificatie zoals in ‘is niet’ tegenovergestelde neurolinguistische effecten op 
de hersenen heeft vergeleken met de uitspraak over identiteit zoals in ‘is’ Noam Chomsky algemeen 
beschouwd als de vader van de huidige taalwetenschappen heeft commentaar geleverd op de kritiek van 
Korzybski waarbij hij aanvoert dat het lijkt dat Korzybski van gedachten is veranderd Chomsky zei 
“Soms kan iets wat we zeggen misleidend zijn soms niet afhankelijk van of we al 
dan niet zorgvuldig zijn Misschien staat er wel meer in Korzybski’s werk maar ik zie 
het niet Dat was de conclusie van mijn scriptie jaar geleden Toen ik Korbzyski zorgvuldig 
doorlas kon ik niets anders ontdekken dan dat niet óf onbelangrijk óf onjuist was Wat 
betreft de neurolingistische effecten op de hersenen daar was niets over bekend toen hij zijn 
werk schreef en heel weinig dat tegenwoordig relevant is” Chomsky een anarchist heeft ook gezegd 
dat de grootste verstoorders van onze waarneming machtsconcentraties zijn zoals staten en bedrijven Hij gelooft 
dat machtscentra over veel meer middelen beschikken om hun eigen standpunten te verspreiden en onze 
waarneming van de werkelijkheid te beïnvloeden dan gewoon alleen het werkwoord “zijn” niet te gebruiken 
Zijn valt in het Nederlands onder de groep onregelmatige werkwoorden EPrime zou dus de volgende 
woorden verhinderen omdat het vormen van zijn zijn De volgende woorden zijn in EPrime wel 
toegestaan omdat ze niet afgeleid zijn van zijn Een aantal daarvan dienen voor dezelfde grammaticale 
functies De volgende woorden worden hetzelfde geschreven homograaf of klinken als homofoon vormen van het 
werkwoord zijn maar hebben niet dezelfde betekenis Deze voorbeelden geven een aantal manieren aan waarop 
het Standaardnederlands veranderd kan worden door gebruik te maken van EPrime Viooltjes lijken blauw Ik 
vind honing lekker En vind dat ook van jou Viooltjes zijn blauw Honing is lekker 
Zo is het ook met jou In het oorspronkelijke gedicht Rozen zijn rood; Viooltjes zijn 
blauw Honing is lekker Zo is het ook met jou drukt de spreker zijn geloof 
in absolute waarden uit “zoals het waar is dat rozen rood en honing zoet is 
is het waar dat jij zo zoet als honing bent” Met andere woorden de spreker 
vindt iets en spreekt die persoonlijke mening uit als waarheid Het is niet absoluut waar 
maar het is de subjectieve waarheid van de spreker Dat is waar Als iemand zijn 
persoonlijke mening geeft en daarbij een van de vormen van zijn gebruikt maakt hij zich 
schuldig aan een denkfout De werkelijkheid is en alles wat mensen over de werkelijkheid zeggen 
is niet maar is hun mening Een mening is geen eigenschap van de werkelijkheid maar 
een eigenschap van de spreker Zijn behoort dus uitsluitend tot het bestaande het zijnde Wat 
iemand beweert over het zijnde zegt dus primair iets over het subjectieve filter waarmee hij 
de werkelijkheid bekijkt Lekker is geen eigenschap van voedsel maar een mening van de eter 
zoals het rood zijn geen eigenschap van de roos maar een afspraak is Dus wij 
noemen een roos rood en zeggen vervolgens ten onrechte dat de roos rood is Wij 
hebben de afspraak gemaakt dat wij de optelling + vier noemen maar + is geen 
vier EPrime probeert dit soort denken en schrijven te vermijden door te wijzen op een 
duidelijk onderscheid tussen meningen opvattingen geloven en overtuigingen en feitelijkheden Dingen zijn niet normaal lekker 
mooi belangrijk en leuk maar mensen vinden ze normaal lekker mooi belangrijk en leuk Een 
EPrimevertaling waarin geprobeerd wordt om de letterlijke betekenis van het origineel te bewaren zou als 
volgt kunnen luiden Rozen zien er rood uit; Viooltjes zien er blauw uit Honing bevalt 
mij En jij ook Het volgende voorbeeld offert de metafoor op die regel van het 
origineel inhoudt “jij bent honingzoet” om de letterlijke betekenis van regel te handhaven namelijk dat 
honing zoet smaakt en daardoor regel vervangt door een vergelijkbare betekenis die dicht bij het 
origineel ligt “honing smaakt zoet en iets in jou zorgt ervoor dat jij net zo 
zoet bent” Rozen zien er rood uit; Viooltjes zien er blauw uit Honing smaakt lekker 
Even lekker als jij Dit voorbeeld gaat ervan uit dat de spreker niet bedoelt dat 
de aangesprokene van het gedicht “zoet smaakt” maar hij bedoelt zoiets als “ik vind jou 
net zo zoet als honing” waarbij hij probeert metrum en ritme van het origineel te 
bewaren terwijl hij toch elke vorm van het werkwoord “zijn” probeert te vermijden Om uit 
het origineel de aanname te verwijderen van iets absoluuts “wat is” en denken en standpunt 
meer weer te geven in de geest van EPrime is de volgende vertaling een poging 
om de bedoeling van een hypothetische spreker ten opzichte van de aangesprokene rechtstreeks te beschrijven 
en die bedoeling te laten zien via het filter van de opvattingen van de spreker 
over de werkelijkheid Onderstaande vertaling verandert dus de bedoeling van het gedicht Rozen noemen wij 
rood; Viooltjes noemen wij blauw Ik hou van honing en ik hou van jou Die 
versie is dus een poging om iets te zeggen dat sterk lijkt op “Ik neem 
de werkelijkheid waar op de manier waarop de meeste mensen dat doen Er zijn maar 
weinig mensen die zouden willen betwisten dat de meest voorkomende rozensoort voor het menselijke oog 
rood lijkt of dat viooltjes er blauw uit kunnen zien Als ik je dus vertel 
dat ik van honing hou en van jou beweer ik dat ik die uitspraak doe

Grypoctonus hatakeyamae is een vliegensoort uit de familie van de roofvliegen De wetenschappelijke naam van 
Nicolaas van Verdun ca was een romaans edelsmid uit Lotharingen en is een van de 
weinige kunstenaars uit deze periode die bij naam bekend is Nicolaas was een ambulant kunstenaar 
die op verschillende plaatsen in Europa opdrachten uitvoerde Zijn bekendste werk is de driekoningenschrijn dat 
zich in de dom van Keulen bevindt en die de relikwieën van de Drie Koningen 
bevat en het grootste edelsmeedwerk uit de middeleeuwen is Over het leven van Nicolaas van 
Verdun is niets bekend; zijn naam is ons slechts bekend doordat hij twee van zijn 
drie bekende werken signeerde en dateerde Het eerste werk is de ambo van de kerk 
van het Benedictijnerklooster van Klosterneuburg bij Wenen Dit werk kwam volgens de inscriptie gereed in 
en was het werk van "Nicolaus Verdunensis" Een dergelijk grote opdracht het is het omvangrijkste 
emailwerk uit de twaalfde eeuw werd ongetwijfeld niet toevertrouwd aan een beginnende edelsmid en het 
is dan ook aannemelijk dat Nicolaas al een groot meester was toen hij naar Klosterneuburg 
gehaald werd De ambo is ons overgeleverd als een altaarstuk in triptiekvorm van hoog Nadat 
in de ambo beschadigd werd door brand is het werk namelijk omgevormd en werden de 
zijkanten van de ambo ingezet als de luiken van het triptiek Het werk bestaat uit 
scènes in email waarvan er origineel van Nicolaas zijn die zijn gegroepeerd in drie rijen 
Elke emaillen voorstelling wordt omzoomd door een driepasboog van verguld brons Deze drie rijen voorstellingen 
hebben elk hun eigen onderwerp de centrale rij bestaat uit nieuwtestamentische episodes De bovenste en 
onderste rijen bevatten scènes uit het Oude Testament respectievelijk voor en na het opleggen van 
de tien geboden Verticaal komt er hierbij een gecompliceerd typologisch programma tot stand Zo wordt 
de engel van de annunciatie geflankeerd door de engelen die de geboortes van Isaak en 
Samson aankondigden Aan de schrijn voor de relieken van de Heilige Drie Koningen werd door 
Nicolaas en zijn atelier tussen en gewerkt Met zijn lengte van breedte van en hoogte 
van is dit de grootste middeleeuwse reliekschrijn Bovendien is het door zijn versiering met meer 
dan edelstenen en parels en antieke gemmen en cameeën en het gebruik van edelmetalen waarschijnlijk 
ook de kostbaarste Deze reliekhouder is het andere gedocumenteerde werk van Nicolaas van Verdun en 
waarschijnlijk het laatste werk van de meester Het dateert van en werd door Nicolaas gesigneerd 
met "Hoc opus fecit magister Nicolaus de Verdun" dit werk is gemaakt door meester Nicolaus 
van Verdun De schrijn meet bij en is gemaakt van verguld zilver en brons rond 
een houten kern en bezet met edelstenen parels en email De schrijn in de vorm 
van een huis met schilddak werd gemaakt voor de kathedraal van Doornik voor de relieken 
van OnzeLieveVrouw die deze kerk bezat Deze relieken werden in de elfde eeuw in processie 
door de stad gedragen om een pestepidemie af te zweren Nog altijd wordt de schrijn 
tijdens een jaarlijkse processie rond De schrijn werd waarschijnlijk tijdens de beeldenstorm van zijn relieken 
beroofd Rondom is de relikwieënschrijn voorzien van een arcade met driepasbogen op dubbele zuilen en 
in het dak zijn medaillons aangebracht met voorstellingen Het meeste van deze gegoten beeldjes zijn 
niet meer origineel van de hand van Nicolaas maar het resultaat van laatmiddeleeuwse of negentiendeeeuwse 
herstelwerkzaamheden De hand van Nicolaas is echter wel te vinden in de beeldjes die zich 
rondom de schrijn in de arcades bevinden Aan het hoofd bevindt zich Christus op een 
troon geflankeerd door engelen met Passiewerktuigen aan de andere zijde bevindt zich de aanbidding van 
de drie koningen Aan de lange zijde bevinden zich aan de ene kant voorstellingen van 
de vlucht naar Egypte de presentatie in de tempel en de doop De andere lange 
zijde is getooid met voorstellingen van annunciatie visitatie en de geboorte van Jezus De schrijn 
is een van de zeven wonderen van België Het werk van Nicolaas van Verdun bevindt 
zich stilistisch op de overgang tussen Romaans en Gotisch en wordt beschouwd als het hoogtepunt 
Jaap Schilder Volendam januari is een Nederlands musicus Hij werd bekend als gitarist en pianist 
van The Cats Hij wordt wel de 'oudste rocker van genoemd Hij componeerde alleen of 
samen vijfentwintig nummers die door The Cats op plaat gezet werden gezet Schilder vormde samen 
met zijn neef Piet Veerman het duo The Everly Kosters toen hij door Arnold Mühren 
en Cees Veerman werd gevraagd zich aan te sluiten bij Electric Johnny The Skyriders Hij 
ging akkoord wanneer ook de andere helft van The Everly Kosters Piet Veerman mee zou 
komen wat ook gebeurde Op een gegeven moment splitste het viertal zich af en gingen 
ze door als de Mystic Four Hun naam wijzigden ze later in The Blue Cats 
en vervolgens in The Cats terwijl ondertussen Theo Klouwer zich als nieuwe drummer bij hen 
aansloot Voor The Cats speelde hij voornamelijk gitaar en zette hij akkoorden onder veel nummers 
Verder had hij een hoog stemgeluid in de achtergrondzang van veel songs Hij is met 
een paar maanden verschil de oudste muzikant van The Cats en wordt daarom ook wel 
de 'oudste rocker van Volendam' genoemd In de autobiografie The Story Of noemde Piet Veerman 
hem ook wel 'De belangrijkste Cat' Medio jaren zeventig kondigden ze aan te stoppen en 
ook Schilder kwam in deze tijd met een soloalbum die in verhouding tot de platenverkopen 
van de band weinig succesvol waren Daarna kwamen ze weer bij elkaar en brachten ze 
de single uit met de toepasselijke titel We should be together In die tijd speelde 
hij ook mee op een elpee Rhythm And Booze van GT Walls in feite een 
studioproject van Jip In was hij sessiegitarist voor het album Boys + Girls van de 
formatie Streetbeats van Jan Toen The Cats in opnieuw uit elkaar lagen kwam hij nogmaals 
met een elpee Absence makes the heart grow fonder als Jay Coster samen met Tanya 
Anja van Scherpenseel De nummers werden geleverd door Golsteijn Na het einde van The Cats 
was hij metselaar en gaf hij daarnaast gitaarles In de jaren negentig vormde hij met 
toetsenist Jan Keizer drie jaar lang een duo; tweestemmig met Schilder op gitaar en Keizer 
op In werd hij tijdens een vakantie in Venetië getroffen door een beroerte die hem 
bijna fataal werd Hierna leerde hij zich weer opnieuw spelen en trad hij ook nog 
enkele malen op Op maart werd hij samen met The Catsleden Piet Veerman Cees Veerman 
en Arnold Mühren opgenomen in de Orde van Oranje Nassau Naast de volgende albums speelde 
hij mee op het soloalbum van Cees Veerman uit Another side of me Schilder schreef 
zesentwintig nummers alleen en samen met anderen die The Cats op elpee en single uitbrachten 
waaronder samen met Piet Veerman het nummer Let's go together dat als single werd uitgebracht 
en op nummer terechtkwam van de Top Met Karel Hille schreef hij een van de 
kerstnummers van The Cats Christmas war Alleen componeerde hij voor Bkanten Mandy my dear geschreven 
voor zijn dochter How could I be so blind The greatest thing en Call me 
samen met anderen waren dat Linda Looking back over my yesterday Nashville Silent breeze Classical 
waves Latin lovers en Canción de la sierra De titel van Mandy my dear ontleende 
hij aan de naam die hij had voorbestemd voor zijn eerste dochter die toen nog 
geboren moest worden Verder schreef hij nog vijftien nummers die alleen op elpees van The 
Cats verschenen Zijn nummers keerden later vele malen terug op verzamelalbums van The Cats Daarbij 
schreef hij acht nummers voor zijn soloalbum Stay ashore uit en twee nummers voor het 
Het Nationaal Bevrijdingsmonument in de volksmond ook Blote Jan in Nederlandse stad Wageningen is een 
monument ter nagedachtenis aan de Tweede In Wageningen vonden in mei in Hotel De Wereld 
onderhandelingen plaats waarna de Duitse bezetters de overgave tekenden In datzelfde jaar werd het initiatief 
genomen voor een capitulatiemonument een jaar later sprak men over Vredesmonument Uiteindelijk werd gekozen voor 
de naam Nationaal Beeldhouwer Han Richters kreeg de opdracht het monument te maken Hij maakte 
een staande naakte man op de sokkel staan leeuwen als symbool voor het geweld Hij 
wilde met de man uitdrukking geven aan "de verlossing uit een groot gevaar en de 
dankbaarheid die daarop volgt" daarmee ook verwijzend naar Psalm Het naakt leidde aanvankelijk tot onrust 
bij de bevolking maar de uitvoering werd er niet door Het beeld werd in brons 
gegoten bij Albert Binder Het monument werd geplaatst op het plein bij Hotel De Wereld 
en op september door prins Bernhard onthuld In werd door Richters een inscriptie toegevoegd die 
verwijst naar de capitulatie van Japan deze werd op mei door prins Bernhard onthuld Bij 
een herinrichting van het plein in werd het monument vijf meter in westelijke richting verplaatst 
Het plein kreeg dat jaar de naam Mei Plein Jaarlijks wordt op bevrijdingsdag bij het 
monument het bevrijdingsvuur ontstoken Het oorlogsmonument toont een naakte man uitgevoerd in brons met geheven 
handen De man staat op een m hoge granieten sokkel waarop in reliëf leeuwen zijn 
te zien In de sokkel zijn diverse inscripties aangebracht VERLOS MIJ UIT DES LEEUWEN MUILZO

de wattenfabriek naar de locatie waar tegenwoordig het Berghkwartier is gelegen De fabriek breidde zich 
uit er kwamen weefgetouwen en stoommachines Het bedrijf oorspronkelijk fa Gebr vd Bergh geheten ontwikkelde 
zich tot een tapijtweverij die later werd uitgebreid met een spinnerij een ververij en een 
spoelerij Uiteindelijk bedroeg het terrein hectare Later heette het bedrijf nog BergossStoddard NV Omstreeks werd 
het predicaat Koninklijk verleend en ging de onderneming Koninklijke Tapijtfabrieken Bergoss NV heten In werd 
nog gesproken van onverminderde expansie die zich krachtig voortzette Omstreeks telde Bergoss nog werknemers In 
vond bij Bergoss een wilde staking plaats die geleid werd door de SP en tevens 
de basis legde voor de verdere ontwikkeling van deze partij In verkeerde Bergoss in surseance 
van betaling nadat het sinds slechts verlies geleden had Dit lag niet alleen aan de 
marktsituatie doch tevens aan slecht beleid In werd de directie van Bergoss vervangen Het bedrijf 
werd overgenomen door de eveneens Osse concurrent Desseaux Hierbij kwamen van de medewerkers op straat 
te staan Niettemin werd het faillissement van Bergoss in uitgesproken De gezonde onderdelen van het 
bedrijf werden door Desseaux overgenomen en medewerkers kwamen daar in dienst Bergoss bleef nog slechts 
als merknaam voortbestaan Het terrein werd vanaf herontwikkeld Enkele karakteristieke elementen bleven als industrieel monument 
bestaan Het hoofdgebouw waar tegenwoordig Hotel De Weverij en Spahuys in zijn gevestigd en een 
gevel met karakteristieke sheddaken die een onderdeel van een aantal zogeheten sheddakwoningen zou gaan vormen 
Ook zijn er plannen om het Museum Jan Cunen in een van de fabrieksgebouwen te 
vestigen Het merk Bergoss is blijven bestaan en werd voortaan door Desso geproduceerd Daarna is 
de productie meerdere malen geconcentreerd en is het bedrijf meermalen doorverkocht aan internationale concerns en 
Daguerreotypie is een vroege fotografische methode uitgevonden door Louis Daguerre in de eerste helft van 
de eeuw Het procedé werd in door de Franse overheid aangekocht Daguerre wordt sindsdien als 
de uitvinder van de fotografie beschouwd Niet geheel terecht want Nicéphore Niépce maakte al eerder 
foto's Om zijn nieuwe procedé bekendheid te geven gaf Daguerre een boek uit Historique et 
description des procédés du daguerréotype et du diorama Bij daguerreotypie wordt een gepolijste verzilverde koperen 
plaat gebruikt Deze wordt lichtgevoelig gemaakt met jodiumdampen Na het belichten maken van de foto 
en vervolgens blootstellen aan kwikdampen ontwikkelen ontstaan positieve beelden maar wel in spiegelbeeld Het beeld 
wordt gefixeerd in een zoutoplossing en daarna afgespoeld met water Deze beelden waren destijds gedetailleerder 
dan de eerdere procedures Doordat er geen negatief wordt gebruikt is het niet mogelijk om 
meerdere afdrukken te maken Elke daguerreotypie is daardoor uniek Daguerre maakte rond de eerste goede 
scherpe foto Vanwege de hoge ontwikkelingskosten moest Daguerre zijn kostbare patenten duur verkopen en ook 
door de ingewikkelde apparatuur was fotografie aanvankelijk alleen mogelijk voor welgestelden In de jaren verdween 
de daguerreotypie van het toneel Vanaf dat moment werd gebruikgemaakt van de calotypie de voorganger 
van het fotograferen met een negatief Pas in na vele tussenliggende verbeteringen in materiaal werd 
met de uitvinding van de rolfilm door de firma Kodak fotografie voor iedereen bereikbaar Daguerreotypie 
van de Boulevard du Temple in het arrondissement van Parijs Daguerre De afbeelding toont een 
drukke weg maar doordat de belichtingstijd ruim minuten bedroeg werd het verkeer niet vastgelegd Wel 
zijn linksonder een schoenpoetser en zijn klant zichtbaar die lang genoeg stilstonden om te worden 
geregistreerd Dit is daardoor de eerste fotografische afbeelding van een mens Vroegst bekende daguerreotypie uit

Shangcai in de huidige provincie Henan in de staat Chu Li Si was aanhanger van 
het legalisme In vChr pleitte hij tijdens een banket voor een verbod op alle meningen 
die ingingen tegen het keizerlijk gezag Dit kwam erop neer dat het legalisme de enige 
toegestane filosofie in China werd Toen keizer Qin Shi Huang in vChr stierf smeedde Li 
Si samen met de eunuch Zhao Gao met succes een complot om hun opponenten generaal 
Meng Tian en kroonprins Fu Su uit de weg te ruimen en in plaats daarvan 
de tweede zoon Hu Hai op de troon te zetten In vChr werd Li Si 
beschuldigd van verraad door Zhao Gao die zijn neef Zi Ying op de troon wilde 
zetten Hij werd gemarteld en geëxecuteerd door de straf van de "vijf smarten" die hijzelf 
tijdens zijn regering voor verraders voorzien had Li Si zou ook verantwoordelijk zijn voor de

Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm Hanau januari – Berlijn september was een Duits jurist taal en 
letterkundige Hij was hoogleraar in Göttingen en Berlijn en verrichtte baanbrekend werk op het gebied 
van de lexicografie de vergelijkende taalkunde en de mythologie Jacob Grimm werkte vaak samen met 
zijn jongere broer Wilhelm Grimm Samen staan ze bekend als de gebroeders Grimm Grimm werd 
geboren in Hanau in het Landgraafschap HessenKassel Zijn vader die jurist was stierf toen Jacob 
nog een kind was Daardoor bleven hij zijn moeder zijn jongere broer Wilhelm en zijn 
jongere zus Lotte alleen achter Vanaf bezochten Jacob en Wilhelm de openbare school in Kassel 
In ging Grimm naar de Universiteit van Marburg waar hij rechten studeerde Zijn broer voegde 
zich een jaar later bij hem in Marburg nadat hij net hersteld was van een 
langdurige en ernstige ziekte Ook Wilhelm ging rechten studeren Op de universiteit volgde hij colleges 
bij de rechtsgeleerde Friedrich Carl von Savigny Door diens rechtshistorische onderzoek werd Grimms interesse in 
de geschiedenis van de Duitse taal en literatuur gewekt De twee mannen konden het ook 
persoonlijk goed met elkaar vinden Toen Savigny in voor wetenschappelijk werk naar Parijs reisde liet 
hij Grimm al snel nakomen om met literair werk te helpen Al snel werd Grimm 
moe van de rechtenstudie en in brieven gaf hij aan dat hij zich liever met 
oudDuitse literatuur bezig wilde houden Eind reisde hij zonder zijn studie afgemaakt te hebben terug 
naar Kassel waar zijn moeder en broer waren gaan wonen Het jaar erop kreeg hij 
een baantje bij het Hessische oorlogsministerie maar nam al binnen een jaar ontslag In kort 
na de dood van zijn moeder werd Grimm benoemd tot hoofd van de privébibliotheek van 
Jérôme Bonaparte die na de bezetting door Napoleon Bonaparte in koning van Westfalen was geworden 
Bovendien werd hij door de koning tot lid van de staatsraad benoemd In deze hoedanigheid 
had hij weinig officiële taken en dus konden hij en zijn broer de bibliotheek voor 
hun eigen onderzoek gebruiken Onder andere verzamelden ze in deze tijd sprookjes waarvan het eerste 
deel in werd gepubliceerd In werd het Koninkrijk Westfalen na de nederlaag van Napoleon opgeheven 
en het Keurvorstendom Hessen weer hersteld Wegens Grimms goede kennis van het Frans werd hij 
in de diplomatieke dienst van het keurvorstendom opgenomen Hij onderhandelde in Parijs over de teruggave 
van door Fransen uit Hessen geroofde kunstschatten en in was hij secretaris van de delegatie 
op het Congres van Wenen Zijn verblijf in Wenen gebruikte hij ook om in de 
Weense bibliotheek oude handschriften te onderzoeken In verliet Grimm de diplomatieke dienst Wilhelm Grimm was 
inmiddels in dienst van de bibliotheek van Kassel en in werd Jacob Grimm daar tweede 
bibliothecaris In stierf de eerste bibliothecaris Toen Jacob en Wilhelm Grimm tegen hun verwachting in 
niet tot eerste en tweede bibliothecaris bevorderd werden begonnen ze ontevreden naar een andere betrekking 
om te zien In verhuisden de gebroeders Grimm naar Göttingen dat in het Koninkrijk Hannover 
lag Jakob Grimm werd er hoogleraar in de Duitse taal en literatuur en juristisch bibliothecaris 
aan de universiteit; zijn broer werd onderbibliothecaris Toen de gebroeders Grimm in als leden van 
de Göttinger Sieben tegen de afschaffing van de liberale grondwet protesteerden werden ze ontslagen en 
uit het land verbannen De broers keerden terug naar Kassel In werden de gebroeders Grimm 
door de Pruisische koning Frederik Willem IV uitgenodigd om in Berlijn hoogleraar te worden en 
lid te worden van de Pruisische Academie van Wetenschappen Jacob Grimm hoefde niet vaak te 
onderwijzen en deed dat dan ook zelden In stierf Jacob Grimm op leeftijd in Berlijn 
aan de gevolgen van een beroerte Jacob en Wilhelm Grimm tekenden veel – vooral Duitse 
– volkssprookjes en sagen op die ze tussen en als schrijversnavertellers publiceerden onder de titel 
Kinder und Hausmärchen Jacob Grimm formuleerde in in zijn Deutsche Grammatik de wetmatigheid die in 
de historische taalkunde de eerste Germaanse klankverschuiving beschrijft Hoewel hij niet de eerste was die 
deze klankwet beschreef staat hij algemeen bekend als de wet van Grimm Het laatste grote 
project van de gebroeders Grimm was het Deutsches Wörterbuch een groot beschrijvend woordenboek van het 
Duits waaraan beiden vanaf werkten Het eerste deel verscheen in maar de afronding van het 
project hebben ze niet meer meegemaakt het laatste deel werd voltooid in Jacob Grimm was 
ook actief op het terrein van de rechtsgeschiedenis Hij publiceerde in een collectie Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer 
Later begon hij met de uitgave van een omvangrijke verzameling zogeheten wijsdommen onder de titel 
Deutsche Weisthümer delen Göttingen Grimm meende dat hij hierin het oeroude gewoonterecht van het Duitse 
Rijk had vastgelegd Deze visie heeft lang standgehouden maar tegenwoordig veronderstelt men dat in deze 
teksten een veel jongere rechtssituatie is vastgelegd In dat boek beschrijft hij het Lohnse hofrecht 
welke ook in Nederland in de Heerlijkheid Bredevoort werd Tot de publicaties van Jacob Grimm 
behoren de volgende werken Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann Heinrich Ewald Georg Gottfried Gervinus

Azië wordt gegeten Een molleboon is een geroosterde paardenboon een soort tuinboon Het roosteren gebeurde 
op twee manieren Mollebonen hebben een licht zoete smaak Tegenwoordig worden ze vooral in Groningen 
stad en land weer meer verkocht onder andere bij lokale slagers of notenwinkels en bij 
de Groningse VVV's Ook bij de winkel van Het Groninger Landschap en bij enkele Groninger 
borgen worden ze nog verkocht passend bij de entourage van de borg Buiten Groningen zijn

Het Klooster van de Zusters van de Goddelijke Voorzienigheid is een voormalig klooster in de 
WestVlaamse stad Roeselare gelegen aan de ArmeKlarenstraat Het klooster werd gebouwd in dus vlak na 
de Eerste Wereldoorlog met steun van het Britse en Amerikaanse Rode Kruis Bij het klooster 
hoorde namelijk ook een volksdispensarium dat door de zusters werd verzorgd en waar armere bewoners 
van Roeselare terecht konden Het in rode bakstenen uitgevoerde complex beschikt over een kapel welke 
dwars op de kloostervleugel is geplaatst en voorzien is van een dakruiter De kapel wordt 
overwelfd door een spitstongewelf In het interieur van het klooster zijn de muurkasten van de 
De Sonate voor twee piano's en slagwerk Sz BB ook Concert voor twee piano's met 
orkest is een compositie van Béla Bartók uit Het werk ging in première met de 
componist en zijn tweede vrouw Ditta PásztoryBartók op piano en de slagwerkers Saul Goodman en 
Henry op het verjaardagsconcert van de International Society for Contemporary Music ISCM op januari in 
Het werk werd enthousiast door de pers ontvangen en werd sindsdien een van de meest 
gespeelde werken van de componist De partituur schrijft vier uitvoerende musici voor twee pianisten en 
twee slagwerkers die zeven verschillende typen instrumenten bespelen pauken grote trom bekkens triangel kleine troms 
snare drums zowel een met de snaren aan en een met de snaren uit gong 
en xylofoon In de uitgegeven partituur geeft de componist zeer gedetailleerde aanwijzingen voor de opstelling 
van de instrumenten en piano's maar ook voor de slagwerkers Zo wordt bijvoorbeeld aangegeven welk 
deel van de bekkens moet worden aangeslagen en met welk soort Bartók behandelt ook de 
piano's in dit werk veelal als slaginstrument De twee pianopartijen zijn qua technische moeilijkheid ongeveer 
gelijkwaardig In de versie zonder orkest schrijft Bartók voor dat een van de twee pianisten 
de repetities en uitvoering moet leiden en verantwoordelijk is voor het ensemble Deze pianist moet 
erop toezien dat de aanwijzingen in de partituur zo nauwgezet mogelijk opgevolgd worden In de 
thema's wordt door de componist met grote regelmaat de Fibonaccireeks gebruikt als Het werk bestaat 
uit drie afzonderlijke delen In inspireerde uitgever en impresario Heinsheimer Bartók om het werk te 
orkestreren Dit resulteerde in de tweede versie van het werk met als titel Concert voor 
twee piano's met orkest De vier solisten behielden in essentie hun De wereldpremière van de 
orkestversie was in de Royal Albert Hall in Londen tijdens een concert van de Royal 
Philharmonic Society op november met Ernest Gillegin en Frederick Bradshaw slagwerk Louis Kentner en Ilona 
Kabos piano's en het London Philharmonic Orchestra onder leiding van Adrian De componist en Ditta

De Kuria Muriaeilanden Arabisch جزر خوريا موريا; DIN Duits Ǧuzur Ḫūriyā Mūriyā; Engelse romanisering Juzur 
Khurīyā Murīyā of Khūryān Mūryān ook getranslitereerd als Khuriya Muriyaeilanden of Churiya Muriyaeilanden zijn een 
groep van vijf eilanden in de Arabische Zee De archipel ligt in de gelijknamige Kuria 
Muriabaai op ongeveer kilometer uit de zuidoostkust van Oman en strekt zich in westoostelijke richting 
uit over ongeveer kilometer De eilanden hebben een totale oppervlakte van ongeveer en vormen onderdeel 
van Oman waarbinnen ze onderdeel vormen van de wilaya Sjalim en Hallaniyateilanden van het gouvernement 
Dhofar Van west naar oost heten de eilanden alHasikiyah alSawda alHallaniyah Qarzawit en De eilanden 
vormen de toppen van een oceanische bergrug en bestaan overwegend uit graniet en muschelkalk De 
eilanden steken uit tot ongeveer meter boven de zee maar kennen ook laaglandgebieden De lichte 
rotseilanden zijn slechts spaarzaam bedekt met enkele struiken De eilanden alQibliyah en alHasikiyah zijn licht 
met guano bedekt die echter niet rendabel is voor exploitatie De eilanden worden door hun 
afgelegenheid en ontoegankelijkheid en met name vanwege de chareef de ZuidOmaanse moesson slechts zelden door 
toeristen bezocht De eilandengroep is een belangrijke broedplaats voor zeevogels met name voor sommige gierzwaluwachtigen 
uit de zuidelijke oceanen De belangrijkste bedreiging voor deze vogelsoorten op de eilanden bestaan uit 
uitheemse huisdieren met name verwilderde geiten op alHallaniyah katten op alHallaniya en alSawda en ratten 
bruine ratten op alHasikiyah en zwarte ratten op alHallaniyah Van staatswege wordt hiertegen tot op 
heden niets ondernomen Er zijn echter wel plannen om op de vier grotere eilanden vogelbeschermingsgebieden 
in te stellen zie de onderstaande tabel Deze oppervlaktes zijn allen groter dan de landoppervlaktes 
van de eilanden en omvatten ook het omringende zeegebied De toekomstige reservaten omvatten alle belangrijke 
In de oudheid werd de eilandengroep aangeduid als de Eilanden van Zenobios Latijn Zenobii Insulae 
Grieks Ζηνοβίου νησία; Zenobiou nesia of Doliche Grieks Δολίχη De baai van Kuria Muria werd 
destijds in het Latijn Sinus Sachalites en in het Grieks Σαχαλίτης κόλπος; Sachalites kolpos genoemd 
en de eilandengroep markeerde toen de grens tussen het rijk van de Parthen en het 
oudZuidarabische Hadramaut–koninkrijk waarbij de binnenzijde van de baai de grens vormde van het Parthische beschreef 
ze als zeven kleine eilanden de beide rotsen voor het eiland alQibliyya werden waarschijnlijk meegeteld 
die in de 'Sinus Sachalites' in de richting van Indië aan de ingang van de 
"Perzische Golf" De onherbergzaamheid van de natuurlijke omgeving heeft ertoe geleid dat de eilandbewoners zich 
overwegend bezig gingen houden met de visserij In de eeuw schreef alIdrisi dat de eilanden 
behoorden tot de invloedssfeer van de kuststad elSchiḥr behoorden In de winter waren de inwoners 
zeer arm en alleen in het vaarseizoen lukte het hen om enigszins te kunnen rondkomen 
Hun zeereizen brachten hen naar Oman Aden en Jemen De belangrijkste handelsgoederen waren schildpad en 
soms ook barnsteen AlIdrisi noemde de Kuria Muriabaai in in zijn berichten Ǧawn alḤašīš Baai 
van de De eilandengroep werd op haar beurt bezocht door Arabische stammen uit de Hadramautische 
steden elSchiḥr en Mukallā en de Jemenitische stam Ḥudaida die de rijke voorkomens van guano 
op de eilanden alHasikiyya en alQibliyya exploiteerden De uitwerpselen van de ontelbare zeevogels diende als 
mest met name voor de verbouw van tabak De Kuria Muriaeilanden kwamen pas in de 
Vroegmoderne tijd weer in het bewustzijn van de Europeanen toen ze door Afonso d'Albuquerque op 
zijn weg naar Indië in het jaar herontdekt werden De Portugezen gaven de eilanden de 
ook nu nog in Europa gebruikelijke Hoewel de oorspronkelijke betekenis van de namn onbekend is 
verwijst de naam „Curia Muria“ naar de Portugese versie van de „Churian Murian“ van de 
middeleeuwse Arabische De eilanden werden ook door andere Portugese historici beschreven Almeida tekent in een 
vrij onbekende beschrijving de reis van twee jezuïeten naar de eilanden In januari zouden Antonio 
De Montserrat en de veel bekendere Pedro Páez zes of zeven dagen op de eilanden 
hebben Volgens Almeida lagen de eilanden verwijderd van het vasteland De jezuïeten gingen aan land 
op een van de eilanden die ze „Suadie“ waarschijnlijk asSauda' noemden en die in de 
nabijheid van een eiland genaamd „Hazquie“ waarschijnlijk alHasikiya lag De missionarissen beschreven beide eilanden als 
zeer klein en de inwoners als zeer arm De bewoners zouden hun huizen met aan 
land gespoeld zeegras hebben bedekt en uitsluitend van de visvangst hebben geleefd Daar ze geen 
hout hadden om op te koken droogden ze de vissen eerst in de zon en 
aten ze dan rouw De zee scheen veel barnsteen aan land te spoelen die ze 
vervolgens de paters in grote hoeveelheden voor weinig geld In het jaar overvielen de Qawasim 
de eilanden vanuit het emiraat Ras alChaima met het voorwendsel ze als steunpunt voor overvallen 
op handelsschepen te gebruiken piraterij Alle inwoners werden verdreven en de eilanden waren aldus enige 
jaren onbewoond Enige tijd later waarschijnlijk enige tijd na de kwamen de eilanden in handen 
van de Ibn Chalfān een ondergroep van de stam Māḥrā Mehri die in de omgeving 
van Mirbat woonden Van deze clan is de ZuidArabische naam voor de eilanden „Dsjazāʾir bin 
Chalfān“ In het midden van de eeuw werden de eilanden deel van het Sultanaat van 
Masqat Saiddynastie van Oman In die tijd kwamen er van tijd tot tijd Franse plantagebezitters 
vanaf het eiland Réunion om er guano in te slaan Het was deze waardevolle natuurlijke 
grondverbeteraar die de Britse regering er in toe aanzette om er bij Sultan Said ibn 
Sultan op aan te dringen om de eilanden aan het Britse Rijk over te laten 
Deze overdracht vond officieel plaats middels een erkenningsverdrag op juli Van tot voeren tot schepen 
gelijktijdig naar de archipel en haalden zo in totaal ongeveer ton guano van de eilanden 
alHasikiya en In het jaar werd op alHallaniya een communicatiestation gebouwd voor een zeekabel van 
de Britse Red Sea and Karachi Telegraph Company Het idee om het eiland als een 
tussenstation te gebruiken werd echter reeds het jaar daarop alweer losgelaten daar de zeekabel niet 
goed In werden de eilanden tot onderdeel van de Britse kroonkolonie Aden gemaakt en onder 
jurisdictie van de gouverneur aldaar geplaatst Later werd de kroonkolonie omgevormd tot een protectoraat In 
december ondernam kolonel S B Miles van het schip de HMS Dragon een onderzoeksreis langs 
de zuidelijke kusten van het Arabisch Als een van de laatste plekken bezocht hij Vanaf 
nam de Britse hoogcommissaris van Aden het bestuur over de eilanden over Na de samenvoeging 
van die kolonie met de ZuidArabische Federatie nam in de Britse "Chief Political Resident of 
the Persian Gulf" in Bahrein het bestuur over Op november werden de eilanden onder protest 
van de Democratische Volksrepubliek Jemen teruggegeven aan het sultanaat Oman dat op dat moment tot 
zelf echter nog een Brits protectoraat Deze overdracht leidde ook in recentere jaren nog tot 
spanningen tussen Jemen en Oman daar de eilanden zich uitstrekken tot buiten de Exclusieve Economische 
Zone van Oman Vermoed wordt verder dat zich olie en gasvoorraden in het gebied van 
de eilanden bevinden In werd het meningsverschil over het grensverloop bijgelegd tussen beide landen met

over de weg via Hulten is het kilometer omdat de Molenschotse Heide en vliegbasis GilzeRijen 
en de ertussenin liggen Vóór de vestiging van de vliegbasis was dit niet het geval 
en liep er een nagenoeg rechte weg naar Gilze over de Nerhovensche Heide Het bedevaartsplaatsje 
Molenschot ligt westelijk het verst van Tilburg Gilze en Hulten dat in de oorlog grotendeels 
verwoest werd liggen sinds de laatste uitbreiding van de Reeshof dichter bij het Tilburgse woongebied 
dan bij Rijen of Molenschot Het mediaconcern Audax en de vliegbasis zijn grote werkgevers; verder 
bieden Tilburg Breda en Oosterhout werkgelegenheid Bij Molenschot zijn jaar oude bewoningsresten van de Tjongercultuur 
gevonden maar van de andere kernen is uit prehistorische tijden weinig bekend De naam Gilze 
duikt voor het eerst op in een schenkingsakte van Hilsondis gravin van Strijen aan de 
Abdis van Thorn Hoewel de echtheid van de akte wordt betwist moet de schenking voor 
het begin van de eeuw hebben plaatsgehad Hierdoor is Gilze een van de oudste plaatsen 
in de Baronie van Breda De Abdis hield tot aan de Franse Revolutie belangrijke rechten 
en bezittingen op Gilze ondanks het feit dat het gebied inmiddels in bezit was van 
de Heer van Breda De Heer van Breda stelde in de eeuw de Schepenbank van 
Gilze in Deze was samengesteld uit een door die Heer benoemde schout en zeven schepenen 
Zij waren zowel bestuurders als rechters in civiele zaken De boet en lijfstraffelijke rechtspraak was 
voorbehouden aan de schepenbank van de stad Breda Naast de schepenbank bestond er nog een 
college van negen gezworenen Zij mochten hun stem uitbrengen en gehoord worden over financiële zaken 
De schepenbank van de Abdis van Thorn samengesteld uit een meier en zeven schepenen was 
een cijns of laatgerecht Tot hun bevoegdheid behoorde de certificatie van eigendomsovergang en eigendomsbezwaringen onder 
het rechtsgebied van de abdis Van de schepenen waren er steeds drie afkomstig uit Gilze 
twee uit Oosterhout één uit Ginneken en één uit Princenhage of Rijsbergen Rijen was een 
buurtschap van Gilze Hierin kwam verandering toen dit dorp in een kapel kreeg en in 
verheven werd tot zelfstandige parochie Het is ook vanaf dit moment dat de dubbele naam 
Gilze en Rijen voor de huidige gemeente in gebruik is Hulten was aanvankelijk een van 
Gilze onafhankelijk gebied dat door de Abdis van Thorn in leen was uitgegeven Aan het 
eind van de eeuw werd Hulten bij Gilze gevoegd en het eigen gerecht opgeheven De 
inwoners van Hulten vielen voortaan onder de rechtspraak van de schepenen van Gilze In de 
Tachtigjarige Oorlog had Gilze zwaar te lijden van soldatenbendes Op mei vielen soldaten uit Herentals 
Vilvoorde en Wouw midden in de nacht het dorp Gilze binnen Zij roofden het vee 
en andere goederen en staken de kerk de hoeven en huizen in brand Wat nog 
gered kon worden werd kort daarna geroofd door ruiters uit Antwerpen en Bergen op Zoom 
die toen bovendien verschillende inwoners vermoordden Het dorp verkeerde in een rampzalige toestand De zware 
oorlogslasten maakten de situatie nog erger Zo waren er verplichte leveranties van hooi en haver 
aan de troepen en wagendiensten voor het vervoer van levensmiddelen en munitie naar het Spaanse 
legerkamp bij Antwerpen Veel inwoners verlieten toen hun dorp Zo is bekend dat in verschillende 
kinderen uit Gilze in Breda werden gedoopt De beëindiging van de Tachtigjarige Oorlog betekende nog 
geen verbetering voor Gilze en Rijen Omdat Gilze door de Abdis was uitgeleend kregen de 
inwoners te maken met zware belastingen en de oude gehandhaafde stedelijke voorrechten Twee eeuwen later 
werd weer vuur aangestoken in werd de nieuw gebouwde schuurkerk met een groot aantal huizen 
in de as gelegd na brandstichting in de schuurkerk Ook de herhaalde inkwartiering van troepen 
in het dorp bracht zware lasten voor de bevolking mee Bij de belegering van Breda 
door Spinola in hadden soldaten een kamp in Gilze In vond hier een grote militaire 
oefening plaats De inkwartiering tijdens de Franse Revolutie in de Belgische opstand in en de 
daaropvolgende jaren waren moeilijk voor de Gilzenaren Legerdiensten en verplichte leveranties waren voor de inwoners 
dagelijkse kost Het kamp Vijf Eiken bij Rijen waaraan het Oosterhoutse industrieterrein zijn naam ontleent 
is nog een herinnering aan deze tijd Naast de landbouw kwam in de eeuw de 
leerlooierij op gang Leerlooien werd destijds nog als nevenactiviteit uitgeoefend op de boerderij De officiële 
ingebruikname van de spoorlijn BredaTilburg op oktober betekende vooral voor Rijen een mogelijkheid tot verdere 
uitbreiding van de industrie De spoorlijn garandeerde immers de aanvoer van grondstoffen Daarnaast maakte de 
toepassing van snelwerkende extracten waardoor het looiproces aanzienlijk kon worden verkort het gebruik van machines 
in de eeuw mogelijk Er ontstonden leerfabrieken waarmee de basis gelegd was voor de schoenindustrie 
Sinds het begin van de eeuw werd de productie van schoenen geconcentreerd in een aantal 
grote of kleine fabrieken Voor die tijd werden de schoenen handmatig door thuiswerkers in elkaar 
gezet In de gemeente bestonden ook enkele steenbakkerijen De steenfabriek in Rijen het eerste bedrijf 
van enige omvang dat zich hier na de aanleg van de spoorlijn vestigde was de 
grootste en modernste steenfabriek in NoordBrabant Nu is deze fabriek gesloten Naast de schoen en 
lederfabrieken vestigde zich in de NV Electrische Weegwerktuigenfabriek nu Ericsson Telecommunicatie BV in Rijen In 
werd op de Molenheide de Eerste Nederlandsche Vliegvereeniging ENV opgericht de eerste vliegschool in Nederland 
en de enige instantie die vliegbrevetten uit mocht reiken zonder voorafgaande ministeriële beschikking Vanaf kwam 
het vliegveld steeds meer in handen van de Luchtvaartafdeeling voorloper van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht Op 
de Molenheide en de Nerhovensche Heide werd toen de grondslag gelegd voor de huidige vliegbasis 
GilzeRijen Oostelijker werd eind jaren dertig voor burgergebruik Vliegveld Nerhoven aangelegd maar dit werd in 
ook overgenomen Op juli werd het voor het eerst in de Nederlandse geschiedenis warmer dan 
graden met in GilzeRijen een nieuw Nederlands hitterecord Daags ervoor op juli werd het in 
Eindhoven al waarmee het oude record van op augustus in het Gelderse Warnsveld bij Zutphen

De heraldiek is ontstaan als de beschrijving van de wapenschilden en herkenningstekens van de kruisridders 
en de bewapende ridders en deelnemers aan toernooien in de Middeleeuwen De oorsprong in de 
kruistochten waarbij veel ridders een kruis op hun schild of mantel plaatsten verklaart waarom het 
kruis in de Europese heraldiek zoveel aandacht kreeg In de eeuw was het kruis het 
symbool bij uitstek van het christendom geworden De kruisridders die tegen de mohammedanen heidenen of 
ketters vochten konden in het kruis op hun schild een symbool van hun religie zien 
Op wapenschilden van Joden en op wapenschilden van nietchristenen zoals de Japanse keizer en de 
Indiase vorsten komen geen kruisen voor Een kruis kan een deel van een sprekend wapen 
zijn Een familie Zwartkruis Kruiskamp of De la Croix kan een kruis als ware het 
een rebus in het wapen plaatsen Desondanks waren er vanaf de eeuw ook veel andere 
afbeeldingen zoals geometrische patronen herautstukken genaamd en wapendieren waarbij vooral leeuw en adelaar veel voorkwamen 
kruisen zijn altijd populair gebleven Ook in de Faleristiek de hulpwetenschap die de tekenen van 
de ridderorden beschrijft komen de hier beschreven kruisen veel voor In de heraldiek is het 
kruis een oud symbool ouder dan het christendom dat in meer dan duizend soorten voorkomt 
zoals Veel ridderorden voerden in hun standaard een kruis Nog altijd hebben eretekens meestal de 
vorm van een ridderkruis Een aantal landen voert het kruis in hun vlag zoals Zwitserland 
en de Scandinavische landen Het is tevens het symbool van vele westerse gezondheidsinstellingen en organisaties 
waaronder het Rode Kruis dat een kruis van Genève gebruikt De rijkdom aan vormen van 
de kruisen is gebaseerd op de noodzaak om een afwijkend wapenschild te maken Had een 
andere familie al een zwart kruis op goud dan koos een volgende ridder een zwart 
gegolfd kruis en de daaropvolgende een kruis "van het een in het ander" In principe 
behoort ieder wapenschild immers uniek te zijn en tegelijk zo eenvoudig mogelijk vormgegeven te worden 
in verband met de herkenbaarheid Dat verklaart de vormen van de kruisen In de heraldiek 
worden vele honderden kruisen gebruikt Ieder kruis kan immers als schuinkruis en verkort of lang 
het hele veld bedekkend worden afgebeeld Dan kan de heraldicus de kruisen van een afwijkende 
voet of rand voorzien verhogen of met kleuren en tinctuuren metalen verschillen aangeven Ten slotte 
kan men binnen het kruis nog figuren plaatsen Het kruis heet dan "beladen met figuren" 
zoals leeuwenkoppen of andreaskruisen te zijn In naziDuitsland werden onderscheidingen en wapenschilden veelvuldig met swastika's 
het symbool van de NSDAP versierd In de Bondsrepubliek en de DDR werd daaraan een 
eind gemaakt In Finland zijn de hakenkruisen in de kleinoden van Finse onderscheidingen in slechts 
één geval verwijderd; de keten van de vaak aan Europese staatshoofden verleende Orde van de 
Witte Roos Finland werd in van de prominent afgebeelde hakenkruisen ontdaan In de versierselen van 
de Orde van het Vrijheidskruis Finland en ook op de standaard van de Finse president 
wordt de swastika nog steeds In de familiewapens van de Nederlandse en Vlaamse families Dröge 
de Koning Sonnema Ebbinge en van den Elzas komen swastika's Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog heeft 
menigeen het hakenkruis in het familiewapen vervangen door een ander ornament De namen van de 
kruisen werden door Nederlandse schrijvers tot in de eeuw meestal in het Frans gegeven Er 
was geen overeenstemming over de Nederlandse namen Johannes Rietstap en Joan Graafland waren gezaghebbende autoriteiten 
op het gebied van de heraldiek en zij hebben een algemeen aanvaard Nederlands begrippenapparaat voorgesteld 
dat nu algemeen is overgenomen Het kruis van SintJoris is het basismodel van de meeste 
heraldische kruisen Het Andreaskruis of schuinkruis is het tweede archetype van de heraldische kruisen Voorbeelden 
van Andreaskruisen vindt u onder op deze pagina Er is in de loop der eeuwen 
veel gevarieerd op deze eenvoudige vorm In het overzicht staan de door Rietstap en Jhr

Ribbink Van Bork Co was tussen en de tweede grote particuliere telefoonmaatschappij in Nederland Het 
bedrijf legde in totaal elf lokale telefoonnetwerken aan en exploiteerde die later onder de naam 
NV Algemene Telephoonmaatschappij ATM Rond vestigden Gerrit Ribbink geb en de broers Jan Bartholomeus geb 
en Willem van Bork geb een "Stoomfabriek van Elektrische Toestellen" in de Spuistraat te Amsterdam 
Ze werden onder meer de "elektriciens" van het Marine Etablissement Amsterdam Vanaf legde de Nederlandse 
dochteronderneming van de Bell Telephone Company de Nederlandsche BellTelephoon Maatschappij NBTM in de grote steden 
telefoonnetten aan Maar met Leeuwarden kwam de NBTM in twee jaar onderhandelen niet tot overeenstemming 
en in vroeg de Friese hoofdstad andere bedrijven om naar de opdracht te dingen De 
keus tussen twee gegadigden viel daarna op Ribbink Van Bork dat het net aanlegde Op 
oktober werd met de exploitatie begonnen In de Leeuwarder Courant kondigde de firma aan dat 
er een geregelde telefoondienst van zeven uur ‘s morgens tot elf uur ‘s avonds onderhouden 
zou worden terwijl de abonnees ‘s nachts verbonden waren met de politie De telefooncentrale stond 
op de zolder van het politiebureau Onder dezelfde formule volgden andere plaatsen zoals Deventer Middelburg 
'sHertogenbosch Tilburg Vlissingen en Zwolle Voor het interlokaal verbinden van deze netten kreeg het bedrijf 
echter geen vergunning omdat het Rijk één interlokaal netwerk wilde met één beheerder Voorlopig was 
dat de NBTM die echter alleen de eigen netwerken met elkaar In beheerde de firma 
die inmiddels kantoor hield op Keizersgracht in Amsterdam tien lokale netwerken In dat jaar stagneerden 
de particuliere initiatieven doordat de gemeenten Amsterdam Rotterdam en Arnhem de concessies van de NBTM 
niet verlengden en zelf de exploitatie van het telefoonnet overnamen De Tweede Kamer debatteerde in 
die dagen over de vraag of de telefoon een overheidstaak zou moeten worden Op oktober 
nam het Rijk de aanleg van interlokale verbindingen over In het volgende jaar werd een 
wetsontwerp ingediend voor de aanleg van een secundair interlokaal netwerk buiten de Randstad De Tweede 
Kamer verwierp deze wet uit vrees voor een marginalisatie van de plaatsen die niet in 
de plannen waren opgenomen In dezelfde periode hield de gemeenteraad van Leeuwarden de verlenging van 
de concessie met nog eens vijftien jaar vanaf voor Ribbink Van Bork tegen omdat er 
in het kleine netwerk geen vooruitgang zat Er was een vicieuze cirkel ontstaan van onvoldoende 
zekerheid en groeimogelijkheden voor het particuliere bedrijf enerzijds en ontevredenheid bij overheid en burgers over 
de beperkingen van de telefoondienst anderzijds In werd de nieuwe Telegraaf en Telefoonwet door het 
parlement aangenomen In dat jaar werd ook het elfde en laatste lokale net door de 
ATM aangelegd in Kampen Daarna was de enige uitbreiding de aanleg als eerste in de 
jaren van kerktelefoons bijvoorbeeld in de omgeving van Zwolle en Goes Tussen en nam de 
rijksoverheid alle lokale telefoonnetten over en in werd de Administratie der Posterijen en Telegrafieën opgericht

De Brabantsche Yeesten of Gestes de Brabant zijn een vanaf de eerste helft van de 
eeuw ontstane Rijmkroniek met meer dan verzen In vijf later aangevuld tot zeven boeken verhaalt 
het werk in het middelnederlands de geschiedenis van het hertogdom Brabant van het ontstaan tot 
in de late middeleeuwen en de heldendaden van de hertogen van Brabant Auteur van de 
eerste vijf boeken is de stadsschrijver van Antwerpen Jan van Boendale ca Het zesde en 
zevende boek ontstonden ongeveer honderd jaar later De titel "Brabantsche Yeesten" werd door de dichter 
zelf aan het werk gegeven boek I vers "Yeesten" < Frans gestes < Latijn gesta 
zijn daden of heldendaden De eerste vijf boeken van de Brabantsche Yeesten werden tussen en 
ongeveer in opdracht van een Antwerpse patriciër geschreven Ze omvatten verzen en waren door Jan 
de Klerk in Antwerpen opgesteld die als Jan van Boendale werd geïdentificeerd Volgens Stein kan 
de onstaansgeschiedenis van het eerste deel als volgt samengevat Het zesde en zevende boek met 
een voortzetting van de rijmkroniek tot in het jaar werden ongeveer honderd jaar later geschreven 
Auteur en plaats van uitgave van het zesde en zevende boek zijn niet bekend Boendale 
baseerde zich op meerdere bronnen waaronder de Chronica de origine ducum Brabantiae Kroniek van de 
afkomst van de hertogen van Brabant uit en andere genealogieën van de hertogen van Brabant 
Zijn hoofdbron was echter de Spieghel Historiael van Jacob van Maerlant uit dewelke hij zijn 
eerste drie boeken haast woordelijk overnam Boendale zelf schrijft in zijn inleiding dat hij de 
geschiedenis van de hertogen van Brabant waarheidsgetrouw wou weergeven De Brabantse Zwaanriddersage doet hij net 
zoals Jacob van Maerlant als leugen af In het vijfde boek schreef Jan van Boendale 
over zijn eigen tijd De kroniek vertegenwoordigt zonder twijfel het Brabantse standpunt en is niet 
als objectieve voorstelling van de feiten te gebruiken In zijn eerste boek vertelt Boendale over 
de afstamming van de hertogen van Brabant van de Trojanen Dan maakt hij een tijdssprong 
naar de Merovingen en de Pepiniden Het eerste boek eindigt met de dood van Pepijn 
de Korte in Het tweede boek is aan diens zoon Karel de Grote gewijd In 
het derde boek komt Boendale tot de geschiedenis van Brabant De nadruk ligt hier vooral 
op de figuur van Godfried van Bouillon de aanvoerder van de Eerste Kruistocht De hertogen 
van Nederlotharingen worden in het vierde boek behandeld Godfried I II en III van Leuven 
en Hendrik I II en III van Brabant Via deze heerser komt Boendale tot hertog 
Jan I de overwinnaar in de slag bij Woeringen in Het vijfde en tevens laatste 
boek behandelt de regeringen van Jan I II en III Tot kort voor zijn dood 
werkte Boendale aan de kroniek en voegde nieuwe hoofdstukken toe De Brabantsche Yeesten zijn in 
verscheidene handschriften overgeleverd waarvan er slechts vier de volledige tekst bevatten devijf boeken van de 
hand van Van Boendale en de twee toegevoegde boeken Van de veertiendeeeuwse vesie zijn slechts 
twee fragmentarische teksten bewaard gebleven Het gros van de overgebleven handschriften dateert uit de tweede 
helft van de vijftiende eeuw Het werk werd voor de eerste keer gedrukt in door 
Roland van den Dorpe in Antwerpen In en volgden er herdrukken door Jan van Doesborch 
die de drukkerij van Roland van den Dorpe had overgenomen van diens Vanaf werden ze 
door Jan Frans Willems en Jean Henri Bormans opnieuw in drukvorm uitgegeven De Koninklijke Bibliotheek 
van België verwierf in door een ruil met het Rijksarchief twee in de eerste helft 
van de eeuw gedateerde handschriften van de Brabantsche Yeesten ms IV en ms IV De 
beide handschriften op papier bieden de meest geactualiseerde tekst van alle handschriften Het fragment ms 
IV omvat slechts boek vier en is met opvallend realistische beelden geïllustreerd en daarmee het 
enige bewaard gebleven geïllustreerde handschrift van de Yeesten De band ms IV met boek vijf 
bevat lege ruimte voor afbeeldingen maar is niet geïllustreerd De beide banden zijn vermoedelijk afkomstig 
uit de abdij van Affligem Deze handschriften zijn de enige die een verwijzing naar "Jan 
van Antwerpen" als de originele auteur bevatten Ze belanden in in het Rijksarchief door een 
schenking van de verzamelaar Pierre François Ghysel Ze waren slechts door een gelukkig toeval aan 
vernietiging ontsnapt De verzamelaar had deze namelijk van een tabakshandelaar gekocht die voornemens was de

inkomen hoger wordt stapt hij over naar duurder vlees en chiquere kleding Bij het hogere 
inkomen worden het goedkope vlees en de tweedehands kleren inferieure goederen De term inferieur slaat 
niet op de kwaliteit van het goed Als het inkomen maar voldoende toeneemt zal bijna 
elk goed uiteindelijk worden vervangen door een in de ogen van de consument meer gewenst 
goed Op dat moment wordt het vervangen goed een inferieur goed Naast inferieure goederen zijn 
er normale goederen Het is een normale reactie dat er meer van zo'n goed gekocht 
wordt als het inkomen toeneemt De inkomenselasticiteit van deze goederen is positief Normale goederen zijn 
te verdelen in primaire goederen die minder sterk reageren op een inkomensverandering en luxegoederen die

Yoldia kikuchii is een tweekleppigensoort uit de familie van de De wetenschappelijke naam van de 
Cornelis Cees Sipkes Haarlem oktober Oostvoorne januari was een Nederlandse plantenkweker die zich ontwikkelde tot 
tuinarchitect Als kenner van inheemse wilde planten was hij een pionier op het gebied van 
de aanleg van heemtuinen en liet hij zich ook uit over beheer en inrichting van 
natuurterreinen met name Cees Sipkes groeide op in Haarlem Zijn moeder was Therèse Johanna Voet 
Zijn vader Feiko Sipkes kweekte aardbeien en bracht hem in contact met Jac P Thijsse 
gezien Cees' voorkeur voor wilde planten Na het gymnasium in Haarlem volgde Sipkes een opleiding 
aan de tuinbouwschool in Aalsmeer Cees had een zuster die ruim anderhalf jaar jonger dan 
hij In begon Sipkes mede op aanraden van Thijsse een kwekerij van wilde planten Hij 
noemde die “De Teunisbloem” Dat was een eerbetoon aan de hoogleraar Hugo de Vries die 
op basis van kruisingen van de teunisbloem zijn mutatietheorie had bedacht De kwekerij was gevestigd 
aan de Zijlweg tussen Haarlem en Overveen Zijn uitgangspunt was dat de wilde flora in 
tuin en park kan worden toegepast Menig tuinontwerp werd volgens deze conceptie door hem gemaakt 
en Sipkes was al toen de Nederlandse Jeugdbond voor Natuurstudie NJN werd opgericht in en 
kon vanwege de leeftijdsgrens van deze bond geen lid meer worden Maar hij fungeerde wel 
als begeleider op kampen Hij was ook actief lid van de Koninklijke Nederlandse Natuurhistorische Vereniging 
In publiceerde hij een artikel in De Levende Natuur over het kweken van wilde Daarin 
zette hij uiteen dat hij niet alles kweekte maar een “aantal soorten had uitgekozen die 
opvallen door schoonheid bijzondere biologische eigenschappen of omdat ze kenmerkend zijn voor het karakter van 
het landschap geschikt voor rotspartijen voor droge terreinen of voor duinen aan zee” Ook hier 
ontbreken de zelfgemaakte foto's oa van planten op zijn eigen kwekerij niet Hij riep op 
om voorzichtig te zijn met het verzamelen van planten in het wild tenzij er sprake 
is van “ontginningen” van natuurgebieden waar hij dan weer graag van op de hoogte wilde 
worden gesteld In stopte Sipkes met “De Teunisbloem” en ging hij op Voorne wonen en 
werken Hij werd er beheersadviseur van het Administratiefonds Rotterdam Dit fonds beheerde een deel van 
Voornes Duin een gebied vanaf in beheer bij het ZuidHollands Landschap Hij trad tijdelijk ook 
als beheersadviseur op voor het duinterrein van de Vereniging tot Behoud van Natuurmonumenten in Nederland 
op Hij was behalve kweker en adviseur vier jaar docent aan de Hogere Opleiding voor 
Tuinarchitectuur te Cees Sipkes reisde veel en hield voordrachten over zijn reizen onder andere voor 
de Maatschappij voor Tuinbouw en Plantkunde Voor die tijd opmerkelijk was zijn reis ”in zijn 
eentje op de fiets met kampeerbagage en al in naar Marokko en Andere landen van 
Europa die hij bezocht tijdens zijn floristische reizen waren oa Engeland en Ierland België Frankrijk 
Spanje Italië en de Balkanlanden Hij schreef ook over zijn reizen bijvoorbeeld over een botanische 
reis naar Westfalen in in De Levende en over een reis naar ZuidEngeland in oktober 
Hij verlevendigde zijn artikelen met zelfgemaakte foto's In bezocht hij de streek rond BoulognesurMer in 
Frankrijk; in leidde hij er een excursie van de Nederlandsche Natuurhistorische Sipkes trouwde op oktober 
met Geurtje Max jaar geboren te Haarlem onderwijzeres; dit huwelijk werd mei ontbonden door Zijn 
tweede echtgenote was Bep In kreeg Sipkes de opdracht om Thijsse's Hof in Bloemendaal aan 
te leggen en te beplanten Thijsse's Hof was de eerste heemtuin van Nederland ontworpen door 
Leonard Anthony Springer in nauw overleg met Jac P De samenwerking met Springer moet niet 
altijd eenvoudig geweest zijn Zo liet de gemeente Bloemendaal met toestemming van Springer veel voedselarm 
zand afvoeren en zwarte grond opbrengen Daar was Sipkes en ook Thijsse tegen omdat een 
grote voedselrijkdom voor een tuin van wilde planten door hem minder geschikt werd Sipkes bleef 
zijn hele leven als bezoeker en adviseur betrokken bij de Hof en bracht ook vaak 
zaden en plantmateriaal “Op Voorne ontplooide Sipkes zijn talenten als natuurbeschermer en natuurbeheerder Hij bezat 
een welhaast ongeëvenaarde kennis van de In het kader van zijn functie bij het Administratiefonds 
Rotterdam legde Sipkes in bij Rockanje in een gebied dat door de Duitse bezetters in 
de Tweede Wereldoorlog was afgeplagd en ontzand het heempark "De Tenellaplas" Dit was een landschapstuin 
van enkele hectaren groot In de tuin werd met een zandzuiger een ha grote duinplas 
uitgegraven met geleidelijk aflopende oevers Daardoor ontstond een natvochtigdrooggradiënt met een grote soortenrijkdom Gegeven Sipkes 
belangstelling kwam er een groot aantal soorten orchideeën in de tuin De strijd tegen de 
konijnen een andere passie van Sipkes kreeg hier ook veel In de omgeving kwam op 
vrij grote schaal het zeldzame teer guichelheil Anagallis tenella Dat inspireerde Sipkes tot de naam 
van het heempark Het gehele terrein omvatte ongeveer ha Sipkes hoopte dat er zich na 
het afgraven op de oostelijke flauwglooiende oever een vegetatie zou kunnen ontwikkelen zoals die in 
jonge duinvalleien voorkomt met fraai duizendguldenkruid Centaureum pulchellum knopige vetmuur Sagina nodosa parnassia Parnassia palustris 
orchideeën en gentianen Hij verwachtte dat als de konijnen zouden wegblijven de flora na ongeveer 
jaar op haar hoogtepunt zou kunnen Na jaar was het terrein uitgegroeid tot het “instructief 
plantsoen 'De Tenellaplas'” Ook noemde Sipkes het toen al een “heempark” waarvan de aanleg zo 
merkte hij op weliswaar niet direct als 'natuurbescherming' gezien kan worden maar toch in hoge 
mate de natuurbeschermingsgedachte bij de bezoekers bevordert ons leert over het beheer van natuurterreinen en 
ons een richting van landschapsarchitectuur laat zien die door velen gewaardeerd In hij was toen 
inmiddels jaar oud was Sipkes “de man van de Tenellaplas” geworden Terugkijkend op zijn leven 
vertelde hij met enige trots dat hij in de eerste was die in praktijk bracht 
dat wilde flora in tuinen en parken kon worden ingepast Anno konden rond de Tenellaplas 
soorten planten worden geteld waaronder soorten orchideeën en was Sipkes nog niet van plan met 
zijn werkzaamheden in het heempark aan de Tenellaplas te Op zijn negentigste verjaardag mocht Sipkes 
Koningin Beatrix rondleiden langs de Er is wel geopperd dat de activiteiten van Sipkes rond 
de Tenellaplas ook wel tot vormen van floravervalsing hebben geleid Zo wordt algemeen aangenomen dat 
hij de maretak Viscum album op Voorne Bij een excursie van het laboratorium Technische Botanie 
uit Delft in toonde Sipkes vol trots de zaailingen van Viscum op enkele populiertjes bij 
de Tenellaplasherinnering F Lippe In een interview in zei hij “En afgezien van een enkel 
ongelukje vindt sic ik het een aanwinst wanneer planten zich vanuit het park in de 
omgeving In ging Sipkes in een artikel in De Levende Natuur in op het vraagstuk 
van het risico van “ontsnappingen” uit heemtuinen en botanische Een jaar later besprak ook Londo 
dit vraagstuk uitgebreid in een artikel in het “Sipkesnummer” van het tijdschrift In leverde Sipkes 
een bijdrage aan het ontwerp van de heemtuin “Hof van Piershil” in het dorp Piershil 
in de Hoeksche Sipkes heeft ook veel zorg besteed aan het duinterrein rondom het biovakantieoord 
te Bergen aan Hij werkte er veertig jaar aan de loofhoutbeplanting van het Sipkes is 
op verschillende manieren vereerd Zo is er een cultivar van de Italiaanse cipres Cupressus sempervirens 
naar Sipkes genoemd Cupressus sempervirens 'Cees Sipkes' synoniem Cupressus sempervirens Ook is in de duinen 
van Voorne een pad door de duinen “slag” naar Sipkes genoemd Het ZuidHollands Landschap vernoemde 
in ter gelegenheid van zijn vijfenzestigste verjaardag de “C Sipkesslag” naar Sipkes werd vanwege zijn 
bijzondere verdiensten benoemd tot erelid van de Koninklijke Nederlandse Natuurhistorische Hij was buitengewoon lid van 
de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tuin en Hij ontving in december de Heimans en Thijsse Prijs 
ingesteld door de Heimans en Thijsse Stichting Bij die gelegenheid noemde Victor Westhoff hem “een 
onvervalste en waardige nazaat van Heimans en In verscheen een speciaal nummer van het tijdschrift 
Gorteria dat “het Sipkesnummer” werd genoemd dubbelnummer van vol In het nummer stond onder andere 
een artikel van MJ Adriani en BM Lensink Adriani en Lensink en van G Londo 
Londo Kort voor zijn negentigste verjaardag werd Sipkes benoemd tot Ridder in de Orde van 
Oranje Sipkes heeft zijn hele leven veel geschreven In verscheen zijn eerste artikel in het 
tijdschrift De Levende Natuur Zijn laatste publicaties dateren uit In totaal verschenen van hem ongeveer 
Floristische waarnemingen en overdenkingen nemen een belangrijke plaats in Er is de gebiedsbeschrijving van de

Naadam Наадам spel of wedstrijd is het nationale festival van Mongolië dat ieder jaar van 
tot en met juli wordt gehouden Het festival wordt ook wel het "Eriin Gurvan Naadam" 
эрийн гурван наадам genoemd dat "de drie mannelijke spelen" betekent De spelen zijn Mongools worstelen 
paardenraces en boogschieten Vrouwen doen tegenwoordig ook mee met het boogschieten en paardenraces De sportwedstrijden 
zijn enigszins te vergelijken met de Olympische Spelen Tijdens de Naadam komen families van her 
en der tezamen en wordt vaak traditionele kleding gedragen In tegenstelling tot de westerse paardenraces 
van ongeveer twee kilometer zijn de Mongoolse paardenraces tijdens de Naadam vijftien tot dertig kilometer 
en zijn de jockeys die de paarden berijden kinderen van vijf tot twaalf jaar oud 
Hier is het vooral het paard dat geëerd wordt na een overwinning Zij worden gezegend 
door hen met een beetje paardenmelk of arak licht alcoholische gefermenteerde paardenmelk te besprenkelen De 
worstelaars maken na een overwinning een klein rondedansje met gespreide armen als de vlucht van 
een adelaar Het belangrijkste Naadamfestival vindt plaats in de hoofdstad Ulaanbaatar maar ook andere plaatsen 
door het hele land hebben kleinere Naadamvieringen Ook in BinnenMongolië in China wordt het festival 
gevierd Oorspronkelijk was het een religieus festival maar nu herdenkt het de revolutie in toen 
Mongolië zichzelf onafhankelijk verklaarde Voor de jonge mannen vormt het feest veelal een aanleiding om 
grote hoeveelheden arak te drinken In Boerjatië in Siberië Rusland wordt het suurkharbaan gevierd de 
Boerjattische variant van Naadam Sinds wordt het iedere eerste zondag in juli gehouden als herdenking 
van de stichting van de Boerjatische Republiek Het hoofdfestival is in OelanOede maar net als 
in Mongolië wordt het ook kleinschaliger op andere plaatsen gevierd maar wel overal op dezelfde 
dag Een ceremoniële boogwedstrijd wordt in de buurt van een ovoo gehouden waarna de twee 
andere traditionele sporten worden beoefend Eregarde tijdens de Naadam in Ulaanbaatar De Naadam openingsceremonie Mongoolse

Rutger Leert Stappen was een televisieprogramma dat elke zondag werd uitgezonden om uur op RTV 
Rijnmond de regionale zender van het zuidelijk deel van ZuidHolland In dit programma ging de 
presentator Rutger Castricum op stap met een bepaalde groep mensen die in een bepaalde scene 
in en om Rotterdam gaan stappen De eerste aflevering was in september Het programma was 
te bekijken op RTV Rijnmond maar ook op de website van het programma waardoor het 
programma ook populair is buiten de regio tot in België Rutger Castricum gaat eerst met 
de cameraman indrinken bij de groep waarmee hij samen gaat stappen Gebruikelijk is dan dat 
hij een biertje krijgt bij binnenkomst Ze praten eerst met de gastheer over wat er 
ongeveer gaat gebeuren op zo'n avond Daarna maakt hij een praatje met de anderen die 
er zitten Vervolgens vertrekt hij met de groep De uitgaansgelegenheid waar Rutger naartoe gaat hangt 
af met wat voor een groep mensen hij gaat Met punkers goths of metalliefhebbers gaat 
hij naar een concert met studenten of gabbers gaat hij naar een discotheek en zelfs 
is hij gaan kijken hoe nerds en bejaarden gaan stappen Tijdens het uitgaan interviewt Rutger 
mensen en vraagt hij over hoe zij zo'n avond beleven en of het klopt van 
die vooroordelen die mensen over deze scene hebben Rutger blijft professioneel ondanks dat hij er 
ook een gezellige avond van maakt Na een bepaalde tijd vraagt Rutger aan zijn gastheer 
of hij of zij mee naar huis gaat om naar bed te gaan Thuis aangekomen

De Ute zijn een inheems volk in de Verenigde Staten en worden gerekend tot de 
inheemse volken van het Grote Bekken Van oorsprong leefden de Ute in de omgeving van 
het huidige Utah en Colorado De naam van de deelstaat Utah is afgeleid van het 
Utevolk Hun economie was eeuwenlang gebaseerd op de jacht visvangst en voedselverzameling Naast hun thuisregio's 
in Colorado en Utah jaagden de Uta ook in gebieden tot in Wyoming Oklahoma en 
New Mexico Ze hadden heilige plaatsen die buiten hun eigen streek lagen maar die ze 
wel enkele keren per jaar bezochten seizoenaal De Ute kenden specifieke spirituele en ceremoniële gebruiken 
Er waren twaalf historische groepen Ute Hun cultuur werd uiteraard beïnvloed door naburige Indianenstammen De 
Ute leefden gewoonlijk in familieverband maar kwamen als groep tezamen voor ceremonies en handel De 
Ute handelden ook met andere Indianenstammen zoals de Puebloindianen Bij de eerste contacten met de 
EuroAmerikanen zoals de Spanjaarden begonnen ze ook met hen te handelen Nadat ze via de 
Spanjaarden paarden hadden verkregen veranderde de levensstijl van de Ute drastisch Men werd plots veel 
mobieler en men kon anders gaan jagen maar ook de organisatie binnen de stam werd 
beïnvloed Voordien waren de Ute voornamelijk defensief georiënteerd op militair vlak maar dankzij de paarden 
werden de Ute goede paardrijders en krijgers die andere Indianenstammen gingen overvallen Het aanzien binnen 
de stam werd nu gebaseerd op het aantal paarden dat men had en hoe goed 
men kon paardrijden Vanaf het midden van de negentiende eeuw werden de Ute gaandeweg verdreven 
van hun oorspronkelijke thuisregio's door goudzoekers en kolonisten De Ute sloten enkele verdragen om nog 
enig land te kunnen behouden en werden uiteindelijk "verplaatst" naar reservaten Enkele belangrijke conflicten tijdens 
deze periode waren de Walker War de Black Hawk War en het Meeker Massacre dat 
aanleiding gaf tot de White River War Battle of Milk Creek Vandaag leven de Ute 
voornamelijk in Utah en Colorado binnen de grenzen van drie reservaten voor de Utastammen UintahOuray 
in het noordoosten van Utah mensen Southern Ute in Colorado mensen en Ute Mountain in

gebaseerd op Noordse volksliedjes Op het titelblad staat het gedicht "Kjertsi og Bergjekongen" afgedrukt Hurum 
gaf het werk in mei in eigen beheer uit samen met haar twee voorgangers maar 
kreeg geen goede kritieken Met zijn muziek keerde Hurum terug naar het impressionisme en daar 
zat muzikaal Noorwegen niet op te wachten De voorkeur ging toen uit naar Noorse volksmuziek 
meer op Duitse leest geschoeid De Norrøn suite was het laatste voltooide werk voor piano

De Anschlussmedaille officieel de Medaille zur Erinnerung an den Oktober genoemd was een onderscheiding van 
naziDuitsland De onderscheiding een herinneringsmedaille werd op door Adolf Hitler op oktober ingesteld na de 
door hem met dreiging met geweld afgedwongen annexatie van het Sudetenland Oorspronkelijk werd de medaille 
toegekend voor de verdiensten voor de "Anschluss" de vereniging van Duitsland en het Sudetenland Later 
werden ook verdiensten voor de instelling van het Duitse Protectoraat Bohemen en Moravië met deze 
medaille beloond Wie de medaille al voor zijn verdiensten bij de Anschluss had verworven werd 
voor verdiensten bij het onderwerpen van wat restte van TsjechoSlowakije beloond met een gesp Op 
deze bronzen gesp was de Praagse burcht afgebeeld De door de kunstenaar Richard Klein ontworpen 
ronde bronzen medaille heeft een diameter van millimeter Het brons is donkergetint en toont op 
de voorzijde twee naakte mannen die de terugkeer van het Sudetenland in het Duitse Rijk 
symboliseren Zij hebben elkaar de hand gereikt en de achterste persoon op het podium het 
Duitse Rijk trekt de tweede persoon het Sudetenland op het podium De achterzijde toont binnen 
het rondschrift "EIN VOLK ° EIN REICH ° EIN FÜHRER" de datum OKTOBER in drie 
regels De bronzen gesp heeft een breedte van millimeter en is millimeter hoog Op batons 
werd een miniatuurgesp gedragen Er zijn gespen met afwijkende afmetingen bekend De medaille werd aan 
een zwartroodzwart lint op de linkerborst gedragen De kleuren zijn die van het Sudetenland Hitler 
heeft de medaille aan mensen verleend De gesp is zeldzamer; daarvan werden stuks toegekend Deze 
medaille is met een hakenkruis versierd Dat betekent dat het verzamelen tentoonstellen en verhandelen van 
deze onderscheidingen in Duitsland aan strenge wettelijke regels is onderworpen De vier geallieerden hebben na 
de bezetting van Duitsland het dragen van alle Duitse orden en onderscheidingen dus ook die 
uit het Duitse Keizerrijk van vóór verboden Dat verbod is in de zogenaamde DDR altijd 
van kracht gebleven Op juli vaardigde de Bondsrepubliek Duitsland een wet uit waarin het dragen 
van onderscheidingen met daarop hakenkruizen of de runen van de SS werd verboden Het dragen 
van een dergelijk insigne werd net als het dragen van de Orde van Verdienste van 
de Duitse Adelaar en het Ereteken voor de November de zogenaamde "Blutorden" streng verboden Dat 
verbod treft ook de Anschlussmedaille die immers nauw met het nationaalsocialisme en de Duitse agressie 
tegen de buurlanden verbonden is Ook het verzamelen tentoonstellen en afbeelden van de onderscheidingen van 
de nazi's werd aan strenge regels gebonden Veel onderscheidingen werden ontdaan van de hakenkruizen van 
een doodskop en soms van zowel hakenkruis als adelaar Ook in een gedenazificeerde uitvoering mag

Villacher SV was een Oostenrijkse voetbalclub uit Villach in de deelstaat Karinthië De club bestond 
van tot De club was ook in andere sporten actief en de inmiddels zelfstandig ijshockeysectie 
EC VSV is ook vrij bekend Rond was er een Italiaans garnizoen gestationeerd in Villach 
Het garnizoen leerde de bevolking het voetbalspel en op mei werd Villacher Sportverein opgericht met 
blauwwitte clubkleuren Het eerste succes kwam er met de titel van de Kärnter Klasse de 
toenmalige hoogste speelklasse voor een club uit de deelstaat In de beginjaren was Klagenfurter AC 
een van de grootste concurrenten van de club Tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog werd de club 
drie keer op rij kampioen waarna een wedstrijd tegen de kampioen van Stiermarken volgde hierbij 
verloor men telkens van Grazer SC In nam de club deel aan de eindronde om 
te promoveren naar de hoogste klasse maar werd laatste met punten in de groep met 
LSV Markersdorf en Kapfenberger SC Na de oorlog werd de Kärnter Liga voor enkele seizoen 
opnieuw de hoogste klasse voor clubs uit Karinthië In werd de club tweede en kwalificeerde 
zich zo voor de nieuw opgerichte tweede klasse Tauernliga waar clubs uit Karinthië en Salzburg 
speelden De kampioen kon dan via een eindronde promoveren naar de hoogste klasse Nadat de 
club de titel won moest een eindronde gespeeld worden met Linzer ASK en PSV Innsbruck 
waarbij VSV laatste werd De club bleef in de tweede klasse spelen vanaf de Regionalliga 
geheten In werd de club gedeeld tweede met Kapfenberger SV op acht punten achterstand op 
kampioen WSG Radenthein Na dit seizoen besloten VSV en Radenthein de krachten te bundelen en 
ze speelden als RadentheinVillacher SV in de hoogste klasse waar de plaats bereikt werd Omdat 
de competitie het volgende seizoen grondig hervormd werd degradeerde de club echter Het volgende seizoen 
speelde de club in de tweede klasse en hierna werd de samenwerking met Radenthein stopgezet 
Villach nam de licentie over en bleef in de tweede klasse In degradeerde de club 
en kon nog terugkeren voor seizoen en kon daarna niet meer terugkeren In fuseerde de 
club met SK Austria Klagenfurt en werd FC AustriaVSV Kärnten In de herfst van werd 
de naam veranderd in FC Kärnten De mensen van Villach verloren echter de affiniteit met 
de club die nu thuiswedstrijden in Klagenfurt speelde Twee jaar eerder werd FC Villach opgericht 
dat helemaal niets te maken had met VSV maar opgericht werd voor de jeugdwerking In 
fuseerde de club met SV FellachVSV en werd zo SV Villach als eerbetoon aan de 
oude club Na één seizoen promoveerde de club naar de Kärntner Liga en het hoofddoel 
van de club is promotie naar de Regionalliga en misschien zelfs Erste Liga of Bundesliga

Cyborg Victor Stone is een superheld uit de strips van DC Comics Hij is vooral 
bekend als lid van de Teen Titans Hij werd bedacht door Marv Wolfman en George 
Pérez en maakte zijn debuut in DC Comics Presents oktober Vic Stone was de zoon 
van twee wetenschappers die hem gebruikten als proefkonijn voor verschillende experimenten die iemands intelligentie zouden 
vergroten Victor had derhalve een lastige jeugd Victor begon zich in zijn tienertijd te verzetten 
tegen de experimenten om een eigen leven te gaan leiden Hij ging echter met de 
verkeerde vrienden om en belandde zo tijdelijk bij een straatbende Victors leven nam een drastische 
wending toen hij zijn ouders bezocht bij hun werkplaats in STAR Labs Bij een experiment 
met interdimensionaal reizen kwam een monster door een poort het lab binnen Het monster doodde 
Victors moeder en viel vervolgens Victor aan Victors vader kon het monster uiteindelijk terugdrijven door 
de poort maar toen was Victor al te zwaargewond om nog in leven te blijven 
Om zijn zoon toch te redden repareerde Victors vader Victors lichaam met robotonderdelen Toen Victor 
bijkwam was hij eerst geschokt van wat hij was geworden Pas na een therapie herwon 
hij zijn zelfvertrouwen Victor kwam uiteindelijk bij de Teen Titans en verliet dit team nooit 
meer Bij de Titans herwon hij een deel van zijn verloren menselijkheid en het team 
diende als een soort nieuwe familie voor hem Cyborg ontwikkelde een relatie met Sarah Simms 
die het team vaak hielp Na een vliegtuigongeluk liep Cyborg een zware hersenbeschadiging op Zijn 
hersens werden uiteindelijk hersteld door een buitenaards ras genaamd de Technis In ruil daarvoor moest 
hij hen alles leren over de mensheid Hij nam de naam Cyberion aan en werd 
naarmate hij langer bij de Technis bleef steeds minder menselijk Toen Cyberion terugkeerde naar de 
aarde was zijn oude persoonlijkheid vrijwel verdwenen maar zijn verlangen naar gezelschap niet Hij ving 
enkele Titans en plaatste hen in een virtuele wereld die volgens hem hun idee van 
de perfecte wereld weergaf De titans werden later gered door de Justice League Na veel 
inspanningen van Changeling Omen en Raven slaagde het team erin Victors bewustzijn te herstellen Cyborg 
is momenteel de mentor van een nieuw team van Teen Titans Dankzij zijn robotlichaam beschikt 
Cyborg over bovenmenselijke kracht Tevens beschermt het lichaam hem tegen verwondingen en kan makkelijk worden 
gerepareerd Cyborg heeft verschillende wapens tot zijn beschikking Zo heeft hij kleine raketlanceerders en een 
energiekanon aan zijn rechterhand Verder beschikt hij over geavanceerde sensoren en communicatiemiddelen Wat voor wapens 
Cyborg precies heeft verschilt per strip Er bestaat enige onenigheid over welke delen van cyborgs 
lichaam nog menselijk zijn In elk geval lijken de helft van zijn gezicht en bovenkant

Gerardus Johannes Wiarda Amsterdam september – Den Haag juni was een Nederlands jurist Hij specialiseerde 
zich in het bestuursrecht Zijn publicaties hadden een civielrechtelijke invalshoek en ze gingen over het 
snijvlak tussen het publiek en privaatrecht Ook trok hij vaak parallellen met het burgerlijk recht 
Gerardus Johannes Wiarda werd geboren op september in een protestants gezin Zijn vader was rechter 
Hij ging naar het Barlaeus gymnasium in zijn geboorteplaats In begon hij aan een studie 
rechten aan de Gemeente Universiteit van Amsterdam Zijn studie voltooide hij in Het jaar erop 
ging hij aan de slag als advocaat Hij was slechts voor een krappe twee jaar 
advocaat terugkijkend vond hij zichzelf geen goed advocaat Hierbij moet wel gezegd worden dat Wiarda 
een bescheiden man was die zelfkritiek niet schuwde Het ambt van rechter paste echter beter 
bij hem En zo begon in zijn carrière bij de rechtelijke macht als Secretaris van 
de Raad van Beroep voor de directe belastingen in Amsterdam In werd hij tevens in 
Amsterdam rechterplaatsvervanger Eind jaren dertig verving hij een zieke kinderrechter waardoor hij veel meer tijd 
kwijt was aan zijn functie als rechterplaatsvervanger In tijdens de oorlog werd hij dan ook 
rechter Wiarda ervoer het kinderrechterschap als emotioneel zwaar In deze periode verdiepte hij zich ook 
in het Jansenisme Port Royal en Blaise Pascal hetgeen van invloed zou blijven op zijn 
latere werk Ook was hij rechtercommissaris in de strafzaak tegen de meestervervalser Han van Meegeren 
In promoveerde Wiarda bij Paul Scholten cum laude op het proefschrift Overeenkomsten met Overheden waarin 
hij enkele gedachten ontvouwde die later bijdroegen aan de ontwikkeling van het bestuursrecht in Nederland 
en ook voor de ontwikkeling van publiekprivate samenwerkingsverbanden Hij refereerde hierin vaak aan het burgerlijk 
recht Het administratief recht kreeg hierdoor iets eigens iets unieks De stijl van het proefschrift 
is rustig zonder polemiek of andere stijlmiddelen om het proefschrift een eigen originaliteit te geven 
Deze stijl is vrij kenmerkend voor sommige van zijn andere publicaties Hij hield dan ook 
niet van discussies over theoretische uitgangspunten of over de vorm als je toch tot hetzelfde 
resultaat zou komen Het snijvlak tussen publiek en privaatrecht dat hij in zijn proefschrift behandelt 
is een terugkerend thema in zijn publicaties In werd hij benoemd tot hoogleraar Administratief Recht 
aan de Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht Hij aanvaardde het ambt met de rede De wetenschap van het 
bestuursrecht en de spanning tussen gezag en gerechtigheid Zijn loopbaan als hoogleraar zou maar kort 
duren en hij heeft zich nooit helemaal op zijn plaats gevoeld aan de Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht 
Dit kwam deels omdat hij zichzelf te onervaren vond in een bestuursfunctie maar ook omdat 
hij zichzelf als generalist zag en niet als iemand die zich vooral op één rechtsgebied 
toelegde In werd hij benoemd tot raadsheer in de Hoge Raad der Nederlanden waar na 
de Tweede Wereldoorlog ten gevolge van de zuivering vacatures openvielen Gedurende zijn lidmaatschap van de 
Hoge Raad was hij actief als bestuurder onder meer van de Stichting Custodia te Parijs 
nauw verwant aan het Institut Néerlandais In publiceerde hij het preadvies algemene beginselen van behoorlijk 
bestuur voor de Verenging van Administratief Recht Dit preadvies speelde een belangrijke rol bij de 
verdere uitwerking van de algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur Zijn belangrijkste werk is het essay 
Drie Typen van Rechtsvinding uit dat later zelfstandig uitgegeven tientallen jaren tot de standaardliteratuur van 
alle Nederlandse rechtenstudenten zou behoren Drie Typen van Rechtsvinding borduurt voort op een werk van 
zijn leermeester Scholten namelijk Algemeen deel van de Asserserie De denkwijze van Wiarda is naar 
eigen zeggen ook beïnvloed door Meijers wiens gedachtegoed hij heeft meegekregen via FJ de Jong 
Maar hij bleef toch bovenal een aanhanger van de opvattingen van zijn leermeester In Drie 
Typen van Rechtsvinding baseert hij de drie typen op een vergelijking van Montesquieu Van tot 
was Wiarda president van de Hoge Raad der Nederlanden Voorts was hij vanaf de oprichting 
in tot zijn emeritaat in voorzitter van het BeneluxGerechtshof Na zijn pensionering werd hij eerst 
echt actief bij het Europees Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens waarin hij sedert 
de Nederlandse vertegenwoordiger was geweest en waarvan hij van tot president was Bij zijn afscheid 
als president van het Europese Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens werd hij Ridder 
Grootkruis in de Orde van OranjeNassau Nadien vervulde hij tijdens collegejaar bijzonder hoogleraarschap op de 
Tinbergenleerstoel aan de Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam Hij aanvaarde dit ambt met de rede Rechterlijke voortvarendheid 
en rechterlijke terughoudendheid bij de toepassing van de Europese Conventie ter bescherming van de rechten 
van de mens Hij overleed op juni in Den Haag In huwde hij Sandra Moltzer 
dochter van een remonstrants predikant tevens jurist die later betrokken was bij de ontwikkeling van 
armoedebestrijding en de sociale beweging Zij hadden vier kinderen Hij bezat sinds een boerderijtje in 
het Woold bij Winterswijk Hij verordonneerde dat in zijn rouwadvertenties geen van zijn onderscheidingen mochten

ontstaan in de Hellenistische tijd en had veel meer een Grieks karakter De tempel in 
Memphis is vooral gekend omwille van zijn begraafplaats voor de Apisstieren Het Serapeum bevond zich 
net buiten het vruchtbare Nijldal op de westrand van de woestijn De tempel was in 
de Ptolemaeische periode een belangrijk cultureel centrum maar de oudste restanten van de tempel dateren 
al uit de veertiende eeuw vChr De tempel was vanaf de achttiende dynastie in gebruik 
en in de onderaardse gewelven is de zoon van Ramses II Chaemwase begraven Later werd 
de er in de tempel de syncretische god Osorapis Osiris en Apis vereerd Psammetichus I 
zorgde voor een restauratie van de tempel en Nectanebo I vergrootte de tempel met onder 
andere een mortuarium voor de gestorven Apisstieren In de Hellenistische tijd werd naast Apis ook 
Serapis grotendeels aanbeden naast verschillende andere goden In de Romeinse tijd verloor het Serapeum steeds 
meer aan belang en werden enkel de fundamenten gespaard van vernieling De tempel raakte helemaal 
bedolven onder het zand tot Auguste Mariette een van de eerste egyptologen de tempel opgroef 
Om ons een beeld te scheppen van de tempel zijn we onder andere aangewezen op 
schriftelijke bronnen De Griekse geograaf en historicus Strabo leert ons het volgende over het uitzicht 
van de tempel Strabo Geografie XVII I Er is ook een Serapeum bij Memphis op 
een plaats die zo zanderig is dat er door de wind duinen van zand worden 
opgehoopt Daaronder zijn de sfinxen die ik gezien heb soms wel tot aan het hoofd 
bedolven anderen waren nog voor de helft zichtbaar De tempel was omgeven door een muur 
van driehonderd op driehonderd meter Binnen deze muur stonden naast de Osorapistempel verschillende tempels voor 
andere goden zoals Isis Horus Amon Thoth en Astarte In het oosten bevond zich de 
toegangspoort met een dromos Aan het begin van deze dromos stond er een apsis met 
elf beelden van Griekse dichters en wijsgeren Tegenover deze beelden eindigde een sfinxenlaan van meter 
die vertrok vanuit het Anoubieion Er moeten ongeveer vierhonderd van deze sfinxen geweest waarvan er 
enkele tientallen teruggevonden zijn De sfinxen waren omgeven door een muurtje Zoals Strabo aantoont kon 
het muurtje niet genoeg bescherming bieden tegen de aanhoudende zandophopingen In de tempel was er 
plaats voor plengoffers ter ere van Asklepios een god die nauw verbonden was met Serapis 
Er zijn echter geen aanwijzingen dat er in het Serapeum een incubatieruimte voor genezing was 
zoals in andere tempel voor Asklepios wel het geval was Tussen al deze tempeltjes was 
er binnen de muren van het Serapeum nog een grote ruimte die gevuld was met 
winkeltjes woonhuizen en herbergen Er was zelfs een speciale ruimte voor als de koning op 
bezoek kwam Buiten de muren van het Serapeum lag een menselijke begraafplaats maar het Serapeum 
van Memphis kreeg vooral bekendheid als bewaarplaats van gemummificeerde stieren Deze stieren waren tijdens hun 
leven vereerd als de levende verschijning van de god Apis en ze werden volgens Herodotos 
uitgekozen aan de hand van enkele bijzondere kenmerken De stieren werden gezien als de god 
Apis op aarde en daarom werden ze tijdens hun leven goed verzorgd in de tempel 
Bij hun dood werden ze gebalsemd en bijgezet in de begraafplaats voor stieren De stieren 
werden al sinds de veertiende eeuw gehouden Van deze stieren werden er nauwkeurige lijsten bijgehouden 
met de naam en de leeftijd van de stieren In totaal zouden hier vierenzestig stieren 
worden begraven De eerste stieren kregen nog een enkelvoudig graf terwijl er later werd overgeschakeld 
op gemeenschappelijke begraafplaatsen Uit de Romeinse tijd kennen we slechts één stier en de cultus 
van Apis nam steeds meer af tot ze helemaal verdween Het Anoubieion waarmee het Serapeum 
was verbonden richtten de Egyptenaren op ter ere van de als jakhals voorgestelde god Anubis 
die de beschermgod van de balseming was De tempel was opgericht door Amasis en later 
net zoals het Serapeum uitgebreid door Nectanebo I Het tempeldomein had een grootte van op 
meter en zou eveneens dienst hebben gedaan als gevangenis gastenverblijf politiebureau en kantoor van de

Ophaalbrug bij Noorden is een tekening in waterverf van de Nederlandse kunstschilder Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch 
geschilderd rond x centimeter groot Het is een voorbeeld van de vaak geprezen aquarelleerkunst van 
de Haagse Scholers waarvan Weissenbruch een belangrijke exponent was Het werk bevindt zich sinds in 
de collectie van het Rijksmuseum Amsterdam na een schenking door het kunstverzamelaarsechtpaar DruckerFraser Weissenbruch was 
opgeleid in de romantische traditie maar schakelde in de jaren over op een meer realistische 
manier van werken veelal "en plein air" Daarmee zou hij gerekend gaan worden tot de 
eerste generatie van de Haagse School In de jaren begon hij steeds vaker te aquarelleren 
een snelle manier van werken die goed paste bij het werken in de open lucht 
Hij groeide uit tot een van de belangrijkste aquarellisten van zijn tijd en droeg sterk 
bij tot faam die de Haagse School in deze kunstvorm zou verwerven Weissenbruch maakte vaak 
een hele reeks tekeningen en aquarellen op locatie en vervolgens werkte hij die beetje bij 
beetje in zijn atelier af Daarbij vergeleek hij zijn werken soms met patiënten "Ik verbeeld 
mij soms dat ik een dokter ben in een hospitaal en dat die tekeningen allemaal 
mijn patiënten zijn En als ik dan zo rondwandel zie ik er een die mij 
zo duivels bleek lijkt en dan zeg ik wacht eens even ik zal voor jou 
eens wat klaar maken en dan probeer ik hem eens wat op te knappen Sommige 
hebben weleens een hele operatie nodig om terecht te komen Die daar in den hoek 
heeft geloof ik de geelzucht moet ik je zeggen maar daar is wel raad op 
En zo gaat het van den een naar den Ophaalbrug bij Noorden is ontstaan nabij 
Noorden en Nieuwkoop waar Weissenbruch in die tijd veel naartoe trok om te werken Het 
laat een welhaast archetypisch beeld van een Hollands polderlandschap zien licht lucht en wolken overheersen 
De oevers zijn uitgewerkt in donkergroene tinten en grauwe schaduwkleuren welke afsteken tegen de lavendelblauwe 
hemel die weerspiegelt in het water De verdwijnende rivier schept perspectivische ruimte Het centrum van 
het licht lijkt in het verdwijnpunt te schuilen waarmee hij eens te meer benadrukt dat 
alles in het werk ondergeschikt is aan het licht Opvallend in dit schilderij is dat 
Weissenbruch – anders dan in zijn eerdere werken – niet volledig kiest voor een onbedorven 
natuuromgeving Met de afbeelding van de rond gerealiseerde Schipperse brug later in de plaatselijke omgeving 
ook wel de Weissenbruch brug genoemd voegt hij een min of meer modern element toe 
hetgeen een tegenwicht biedt voor het nostalgische karakter van het thema Het geeft een bijzondere 
spanning en tegelijkertijd evenwicht aan dit werk Hij zou de ophaalbrug meerdere malen tekenen en 
aquarelleren Bestudering van deze aquarellen leert dat ze vanuit een eerste snelle opzet veelvuldig zijn

Turku Zweeds Åbo is een stad in het zuidwesten van Finland gelegen aan de monding 
van de rivier de Aura in de Oostzee en is de hoofdstad van de regio 
VarsinaisSuomi Met ongeveer inwoners is Turku op vier na de grootste gemeente van Finland maar 
het stedelijk gebied geldt na Helsinki en Tampere als het op twee na belangrijkste van 
het land Turku is een tweetalige gemeente met Fins als meerderheidstaal ± en Zweeds als 
minderheidstaal Turku was de hoofdstad van de provincie WestFinland tot de provincies van Finland opgeheven 
werden in In de stad wordt met Kerstmis de Finse 'Kerstvrede' uitgeroepen In de voorstad 
Naantali bevindt zich de zomerresidentie van de Finse president Voor de kust van Turku ligt 
de Finse archipel een belangrijke toeristische bestemming Vanuit Turku vertrekken dan ook regelmatig veerboten in 
allerlei maten naar de eilanden maar ook naar Stockholm in Zweden; deze laatste doet dan 
ook Åland aan Turku bezit ook een internationaal vliegveld Turku werd gesticht in en ontwikkelde 
zich in de eeuw tot de eerste stad van Finland De Zweden gebruikten de stad 
vervolgens eerst als bruggenhoofd en later als administratief centrum voor het ingelijfde Finse gebied In 
de eeuw werd Turku ook de eerste bisschopszetel van Finland Turku is eeuwenlang de belangrijkste 
en grootste stad van het land geweest een positie die pas midden eeuw aan de 
nieuwe hoofdstad Helsinki werd afgestaan De enige universiteit van het land was in Turku gevestigd 
van tot aan toen de grote brand van Turku bijna de volledige stad vernietigde en 
de universiteit met de nog resterende overheidsfuncties werd overgeplaatst naar Helsinki De Vrede van Åbo 
waarmee Zweden een deel van ZuidoostFinland aan Rusland afstond werd in in de stad ondertekend 
In januari werd Turku door de SovjetUnie meermaals Turku vierde in haar bestaan onder meer 
met een uitvoering van de vierde symfonie van Aulis Sallinen In was Turku samen met 
Tallinn de culturele hoofdstad van Europa Turku is nog altijd een van de grootste steden 
van Finland en kent een veelzijdige economie De belangrijkste werkgever is de dienstensector maar de 
stad is tevens een belangrijke zeehaven en centrum van landbouw en industrie in ZuidwestFinland De 
belangrijkste producten die in Turku vervaardigd worden zijn machines en voedingsmiddelen Er wordt veel aandacht 
besteed aan de ontwikkeling van hightechindustrie het Turku Science Park telt een groot aantal ondernemingen 
in de bio en informatietechnologie Daarnaast is toerisme een belangrijke inkomstenbron Turku heeft twee universiteiten 
de Finstalige Universiteit van Turku opgericht in en de enige Zweedstalige universiteit van het land 
Åbo Akademi opgericht in Daarnaast telt de stad enkele hogescholen waaronder de grootste van Finland 
en de Turku School of Economics and Business Administration TPS Turku is de belangrijkste sportclub 
van Turku Zowel in het voetbal als ijshockey is de club meervoudig landskampioen IJshockeystadion HKareena 
is groter dan het voetbalstadion Veritasstadion FC Inter Turku is de tweede voetbalclub van Turku 
en werd in landskampioen Het speelt haar wedstrijden eveneens in het Veritasstadion Turku was in 
en speelstad bij het WK ijshockey Opmerkelijk is dat de partnersteden van Turku bijna allemaal 
de tweede stad in hun eigen land zijn Dit komt doordat Turku vroeger de Finse 
hoofdstad was maar dan is ingehaald door Helsinki dat in de titel van hoofdstad kreeg 
Espoo Vantaa en Tampere; vandaar dat de stad vooral partnerschap aangaat met andere steden die 
ook "een bankje achteruit zijn geschoven" Daarnaast zijn er samenwerkingsakkoorden met Aura Kaarina Kimitoön Koski

George Francis FitzGerald Dublin augustus – aldaar februari was een professor in natural and experimental 
philosophy natuurkunde aan het Trinity College in Dublin aan het einde van de eeuw Samen 
met Oliver Lodge Oliver Heaviside en Heinrich Hertz was hij een van de leidende figuren 
in de groep van Maxwellians die James Maxwells theorie van het elektromagnetisch veld herzag uitbreidde 
verduidelijkte en bevestigde aan het einde van de eeuw In na de publicatie van de 
Wetten van Maxwell suggereerde hij een apparaat om een snel oscillerende elektrische stroom te veroorzaken 
om op die manier elektromagnetische golven te produceren een fenomeen dat voor het eerst experimenteel 
was aangetoond door Heinrich Hertz Hij is echter het bekendst voor zijn aanname in dat 
alle bewegende voorwerpen lengtecontractie ondervinden in de richting van hun beweging Dit zou het toen 
vreemde resultaat van het MichelsonMorleyexperiment verklaren FitzGerald baseerde zijn idee gedeeltelijk op de manier waarop 
bekend was dat elektromagnetische krachten beïnvloed werden door beweging Dit baseerde hij op vergelijkingen die 
waren afgeleid door zijn vriend Oliver Heaviside De Nederlandse natuurkundige Hendrik Lorentz kwam op een 
vergelijkbaar idee in en werkte dat uit in meer detail in zijn theorie over elektronen

Satanic Surfers is een Zweedse punkband afkomstig uit Lund Skåne die is opgericht in De 
vroegste formatie van de band bestond uit zanger Erik Kronwall gitarist Magnus Blixtberg drummer en 
later zanger Rodrigo Alfaro gitarist Fredrik Jakobsen en basgitarist Tomek Sokołowski De muziekstijl van de 
band kan worden omschreven als skatepunk Satanic Surfers werd opgericht in de herfst van door 
zanger Erik Kronwall en drummer Rodrigo Alfaro Kort daarna kwamen ook gitaristen Frederik Jakobsen en 
Magnus Lövberg bij de band spelen Tomek Sokołowski ging de basgitaar spelen De eerste demo 
van de band was getiteld Meathook Love en werd uitgegeven in Het eerste album van 
de band de ep Skate to Hell werd vier jaar na de oprichting uitgegeven in 
Daarmee was het tevens de eerste uitgave van de het platenlabel Bad Taste Records Ulf 
Eriksson verving zanger Erik in om vervolgens met de band de tweede ep Keep Out 
op te nemen dat werd uitgegeven via Burning Heart Records Toen ook hij de band 
verliet werd Alfaro de zanger van de band terwijl hij tegelijkertijd bleef drummen Na enkele 
veranderingen in de formatie en het uitgeven via de eerste drie studioalbums via Burning Heart 
Records tekende de band weer bij het platenlabel Bad Taste om in twee albums uit 
te laten geven Na de uitgave van het studioalbum Unconsciously Confined kwamen basgitarist Andy Dahlström 
en drummer Robert Samsonovitz bij de band spelen De band gaf zijn laatste studioalbum uit 
in getiteld Taste the Poison Satanic Surfers werd opgeheven in De band liet in weten 
dat ze na een aanbod van het festival Amnesia Rockfest in de zomer van weer 
zouden optreden op verschillende festivals Sindsdien speelt de band weer concerten In september werd bekend

De term afgod het prefix af heeft hier de betekenis 'verwijderd van' verwijst naar een 
godheid die de spreker of schrijver vanuit zijn religie niet als ware god erkent Het 
is een begrip dat hoofdzakelijk in de abrahamitische religies wordt gebruikt en heeft een negatieve 
klank Deze monotheïstische religies kennen één ware God alle andere godheden zijn derhalve afgoden en 
hun verering afgoderij of idolatrie genoemd is godslasterlijk ten opzichte van de exclusiefware Jahweh of 
Allah In de Tenach de Bijbel en de Koran wordt volgens joden christenen en moslims 
één ware God beleden Binnen het christendom wordt er ook vaak verwezen naar een afgodendienst 
doelend op het vereren van een valse god of heilige; bij de protestanten uitgezonderd het 
anglicanisme wordt alle heiligenverering inclusief Mariaverering verworpen als een 'paapse' afgodendienst De term afgod wordt 
ook als synoniem voor een idool of afgodsbeeld of voor een nietreligieus idool gebruikt; verafgoden 
is dan iets of iemand als idool hebben Een verafgodend persoon in die betekenissen wordt

september moest Lippens ontslag nemen als gevolg van een compromis tussen de Nederlandse Belgische en 
Luxemburgse regeringen Zijn verkeerde inschatting van de financiële markten had massa's beleggers veel geld gekost 
De aankoop van ABN AMRO in onzekere markttijden was volgens zijn critici onverantwoord en had 
direct tot de benarde positie van Fortis geleid De Nederlandse Belgische en Luxemburgse regeringen besloten 
over te gaan tot een kapitaalsinjectie van miljard euro door Fortisaandelen over te kopen in 
de hoop zo de koers van het aandeel Fortis te stabiliseren Het Fortisaandeel was als 
gevolg van de wereldwijde kredietcrisis en de te onzeker gefinancierde overname van ABN AMRO de 
beursweek ervoor zwaar onder druk komen te staan en had al een groot deel van 
haar waarde verloren Lippens' ontslag moest daarbij symbool staan voor de kentering bij Fortis Enkele

Een staalkabel is een kabel bestaande uit stalen draden die rond een kern zijn geslagen 
Een staalkabel dient om trekkrachten over te brengen bijvoorbeeld bij hijswerk liften lieren tuibruggen en 
kabelbanen Een staalkabel bestaat uit draden die tot strengen worden geslagen Deze worden bij meerstrengskabels 
rond een kern tot een kabel geslagen Op hun beurt kunnen staalkabels worden geslagen tot 
een strop of een grommer een staalkabel zonder einde Om een staalkabel te kunnen gebruiken 
is een eindverbinding nodig waarmee deze bevestigd kan worden aan het te hijsen trekken of 
slepen voorwerp Een voordeel van staal ten opzichte van plantaardige touwvezels is dat staal een 
grotere trekkracht per oppervlakteeenheid kan opnemen en bovendien niet rekt en krimpt met het veranderen 
van de luchtvochtigheid alleen met het veranderen van de temperatuur Het is bovendien een materiaal 
waarvan men de eigenschappen tijdens productie onder controle heeft Dat is bij nietmetalen veel moeilijker 
Kabels gemaakt van huid haar en plantenvezels zijn al bekend uit de prehistorie Zonder touw 
hadden de piramides en tempels in het oude Egypte niet gebouwd kunnen worden In de 
oudheid werd de fabricage van touw verfijnd waarna er tot de negentiende eeuw weinig veranderde 
Tegen die tijd werd ijzer een alternatief onder meer bij de bouw van hangbruggen Zo 
werd bij een hangbrug over de Schuylkill River in de Verenigde Staten in gebruikgemaakt van 
ijzerdraad terwijl ook in Schotland en Frankrijk de nodige hangbruggen werden gebouwd Vooral in Frankrijk 
werd daarbij ook de theorie verder ontwikkeld onder meer door Navier Vicat Dufourt en Seguin 
De doorbraak waarbij meerdere draden en strengen tot kabel werden geslagen ontstond echter in de 
mijnbouw in Duitsland Waar touw niet voldeed maakte men wel gebruik van ketting Mijningenieur Julius 
Albert in Clausthal zag de voordelen van beide de hoge treksterkte van de ijzeren ketting 
en de parallel dragende strengen van kabels Dat laatste was een probleem bij kettingen waar 
vermoeiingsbreuken bij gebruik in de mijnbouw bijzonder gevaarlijk waren aangezien bij een enkele breuk de 
gehele ketting faalt Bij kabels wordt de breuk van een enkele draad opgevangen door de 
andere draden en kunnen er zelfs vele draadbreuken zijn zonder dat de kabel als geheel 
faalt Tussen en werkte hij aan deze problematiek waarbij hij onder meer in een trekbank 
bouwde om kettingen op vermoeiing te beproeven Rond kwam hij tot de conclusie dat kettingen 
de oplossing niet waren en begon hij idee uit te werken om ijzerkabels te fabriceren 
daarbij geholpen door verbeteringen door Mummenthey in het productieproces van ijzerdraad Na de nodige testen 
onder meer met de testopstelling die hij eerder gebruikte voor kettingen begon Albert in met 
de fabricage van een kabel Hij maakte hierbij gebruik van draden van die geleverd werden 
met een lengte van tot meter wat het technisch maximaal haalbare was in die tijd 
Hierdoor was hij gedwongen om de draden op een specifieke wijze te slaan Met vier 
draden maakte hij een streng waarna met drie strengen de uiteindelijke kabel geslagen werd De 
met de hand geslagen kabel had een diameter van en een lengte van meter Terwijl 
touw vrijwel altijd volgens kruisslag werd gefabriceerd koos Albert er opmerkelijk genoeg voor om de 
strengen te slaan in de Langslag Hierdoor lag de kabel beter in de schijven en 
kruisten de strengen elkaar niet Op juli werd de kabel voor het eerst toegepast in 
de meter diepe Carolinegroeve in Clausthal De constructie van de Albertkabel was dusdanig dat elke 
draad van buitenaf geïnspecteerd kon worden iets wat in latere constructies meestal niet meer mogelijk 
is Albert voerde ook de eerste vermoeiingsproeven uit voor buiging Nieuwe ontwerpen met grotere treksterkte 
bleven niet uit Dit vergde meer draden per streng iets waar Albert zelf al aan 
werkte In het Verenigd Koninkrijk hoorde Robert Stirling Newall van de Albertkabel en ontwierp een 
machine om strengen en kabels machinaal te slaan Deze strander sloeg rond een kern van 
hennep zes strengen met elk zes draden rond wederom een kern van hennep Dit had 
wel als nadeel dat de lengte van de rechte kerndraad kleiner was dan die van 
de daaromheen geslagen draden waardoor de kerndraad meer rek kreeg te verduren Ook waren nu 
niet meer alle draden van buitenaf te inspecteren De volgende stap was de meerdere draadlagen 
Om de belasting op de buitenste laag gelijk te houden aan die in de binnenste 
laag werd de draadlengte gelijk gekozen Dit kon worden bereikt door een gelijke slaghoek aan 
te houden De slaglengte verschilde daardoor echter met puntcontacten bij de draadkruisingen die in veel 
draadbreuken resulteerden Een van de oplossingen kwam van Thomas Seale in in zijn werk voor 
California Street Cable Railroad De kabeltrams van San Francisco stelden hoge eisen aan de gebruikte 
kabels De kabel moest buigzaam genoeg zijn om via relatief kleine schijven te kunnen lopen 
terwijl de buitendraden goed bestand moesten zijn tegen slijtage Zo kwam hij tot een ontwerp 
waarbij stevige buitendraden gesteund werden door een gelijk aantal binnendraden Doordat deze een kleinere diameter 
hadden kon de vereiste buigzaamheid verkregen worden Tegelijkertijd wist hij draadkruisingen te voorkomen door de 
slaghoek per laag aan te passen zodat de draden parallel aan elkaar lagen De Sealeconstructie 
werd daarna veel toegepast alleen bleek de kabel door de grote buitendraden toch minder flexibel 
en daardoor gevoeliger voor vermoeiing James B Stone werkzaam voor Washburn Moen verminderde de diameter 
van de buitendraden weer die daardoor ook in aantal moesten toenemen De ruimtes tussen de 
lagen die hierbij ontstonden vulde hij op met draden van kleine diameter Deze filler of 
vuldraadconstructie is tegenwoordig de meest toegepaste staalkabelconstructie Een andere constructie met de parallelslag was die 
waarbij een streng van zes draden rond een kern werd omwikkeld met twaalf draden van 
twee omenom afwisselend diameters Deze constructie werd vernoemd naar Warrington in Engeland destijds een belangrijk 
centrum van kabelfabrikanten Onduidelijk is echter of dit type kabel daar tussen en werd ontwikkeld 
Het eerste idee was zelfs al genoteerd door de Amerikaan John Roebling rond maar hij 
fabriceerde deze kabel nooit zodat niet duidelijk is of zijn ontwerp de basis was voor 
de Engelse kabels Naast de verbeteringen in de constructie werd er ook gezocht naar sterkere 
materialen Met de uitvinding van het Bessemerprocedé genoemd naar Henry Bessemer die daar in een 
patent op verkreeg en het SiemensMartinprocedé van werd het mogelijk om staal in massa te 
produceren Dit was een grote verbetering in treksterkte ten opzichte van het tot dan gebruikte 
smeedijzer Halverwege de twintigste eeuw werd op grote schaal overgestapt op het oxystaalproces De eerste 
toepassing van staalkabels in hangbruggen was in de in voltooide Brooklyn Bridge ontworpen door de 
al genoemde Roebling en zijn zoon Washington Met staal was het echter wel moeilijker werken 
doordat dit stijver was dan ijzer Dit bleef een probleem tot men rond begon met 
het voorvormproces waarbij de draden en strengen al voor het slaan de vorm kregen die 
het in de kabel moest hebben Doordat de draden niet meer wilden terugveren namen interne 
spanningen af en de levensduur van kabels toe Een verdere verbetering was het patenteren een 
warmtebehandeling van walsdraad waardoor deze geschikt wordt voor koude bewerking Het draadtrekken wat maakt dat 
de treksterkte enorm toeneemt werd door deze behandeling eenvoudiger Het proces werd uitgevonden door de 
Brit James Horsfall die het daarna in patenteerde waaraan de behandeling zijn naam ontleent Patent 
voor de behandeling van pianodraad was echter dusdanig vaag dat de concurrentie nog geruime tijd 
na het verlopen van het patent niet in staat was dit te kopiëren De draden 
voor staalkabels worden veelal gemaakt van ongelegeerd staal door draadtrekken of koudwalsen van walsdraad Een 
hoger koolstofgehalte betekent een hogere treksterkte Daarom wordt gekozen voor staven met een hoog koolstofgehalte 
van tussen de Mangaan en silicium worden ook gebruikt om de sterkte te vergroten Naast 
trek wordt een draad ook belast op torsie en bij lopend werk ook op buiging 
Diverse staalsoorten zijn gespecificeerd in Europese normen als EN Er wordt veel gebruik gemaakt van 
staal met een koolstofgehalte van en een structuur van fijn perliet Volgens EN is dit 
staalsoort zijn Verontreinigingen met fosfor en zwavel en sporen van koper chroom nikkel en tin 
zijn onwenselijk omdat deze de ductiliteit doen afnemen De walsdraad die zo wordt gefabriceerd wordt 
daarna aan een warmtebehandeling onderworpen Door dit zogeheten patenteren is het materiaal beter geschikt om 
getrokken te worden Na verwijdering van de walshuid kan dan de draad worden getrokken Hierbij 
wordt deze door meerdere trekstenen getrokken met steeds een kleinere opening Door het trekken vergroot 
de treksterkte en neemt de breekrek af Eventueel kan de draad daarna verzinkt worden om 
corrosie tegen te gaan Profieldraden worden wel gewalst in plaats van getrokken Roestvast staal en 
antimagnetisch materiaal worden in uitzonderlijke gevallen ook wel gebruikt Er zijn vele verschillende draadconstructies afhankelijk 
van de toepassing Elke staalkabel bestaat echter uit een kern waaromheen draden of strengen zijn 
geslagen Als er rond de kern alleen draad is geslagen dan betreft het een enkelstrengskabel 
Bij kabels die over schijven lopen – lopend werk – worden echter over het algemeen 
meerstrengskabels gebruikt Deze kabels kunnen op hun beurt weer rond elkaar geslagen worden Deze kabelslagkabels 
worden als stroppen bij de zeer zware hijsen in de offshore Draden zijn de bouwstenen 
van een staalkabel Ze liggen in een of meer lagen in een bepaald patroon rond 
een kern en vormen zo een streng Deze strengen liggen ook weer rond een kern 
en vormen zo de kabel te vormen De treksterkte van een kabel wordt voor meer 
dan bepaald door de strengen en bij een vezelkern voor Staalkabels die vaak in zeewater 
werken kunnen inwendig geseald met een kunststof Hierdoor wordt niet enkel de corrosie tegengegaan maar 
kunnen ook de strengen beter worden gesmeerd en kan zelfs voorkomen worden dat de strengen 
elkaar aanraken De kern ondersteunt de strengen daaromheen en houdt deze in positie Er zijn 
drie hoofdtypes Een vezelkern fibre core FC bestaat uit kunststof vaak polypropeen of natuurlijke vezels 
als sisal of hennep en is het meest flexibel en elastisch maar wordt gemakkelijk geplet 
Het tweede type met een streng als kern strand core SC wordt meestal alleen gebruikt 
voor zeer kleine kabels Het derde type heeft een streng als kern waarvan de opbouw 
verschilt van de strengen daaromgeen independent wire rope core IWRC Deze is de meest duurzame 
en heeft een grote breukvastheid is sterk heeft een lage rek en is goed bestand 
tegen warmte Veelgebruikt zijn ronde draden maar ook gevormde of geprofileerde draden komen voor Gevormde 
draden worden onder meer gebruikt bij gesloten kabels Hierbij komen Zprofielen fulllocked Hprofielen halflocked en 
trapeziumprofielen voor Driehoekige rechthoekige en ovale profielen worden gebruikt om driehoekige en ovale strengen te 
maken Een streng is geslagen van meerdere draden rond een kerndraad Dit kan een laag 
of tier zijn maar ook meerdere De draden kunnen dezelfde diameter hebben maar voor meer 
veeleisende doeleinden zullen verschillende diamters gekozen worden Met behulp van cijfers wordt aangegeven hoe de 
streng is opgebouwd per laag Dus betekent een kerndraad met een binnenlaag van manteldraden en 
een buitenlaag van manteldraden Voor meerstrengskabels kunnen gelijksoortige strengen worden gebruikt maar ook hiervoor geldt 
dat deze verschillend gekozen kunnen worden naargelang de eisen die eraan worden gesteld Aanvankelijk werd 
elke laag van een streng onder dezelfde slaghoek geslagen met draden van gelijke diameter De 
slaglengte van de buitenlaag was daardoor groter dan die van een binnenlaag terwijl de lagen 
elkaar kruisten Dit resulteerde in puntcontacten bij de draadkruisingen met extra buiging en grote plaatselijke 
dwarsbelasting tot gevolg Dit veroorzaakt weer meer slijtage en daardoor een kortere levensduur terwijl de 
kabel tijdens het gebruik minder soepel wordt De parallelslag vermijdt de genoemde problemen door de 
slaghoek per laag zo aan te passen dat de slaglengte gelijk is Hierdoor kruisen de 
draden elkaar niet meer maar lopen deze parallel en maken daarbij lijncontact in plaats van 
puntcontact De diameter van de draden verschilt hierbij wel per laag Als deze niet goed 
op elkaar zijn afgestemd dan ondersteunen de lagen elkaar onvoldoende Enkele belangrijke parallelconstructies zijn De 
strengen van een Sealeconstructie bestaan uit een kerndraad een binnenlaag van minimaal draden omgeven door 
een buitenlaag met een gelijk aantal draden De buitenste draden zijn dikker dan de binnenste 
Dit is de meest robuuste strengconstructie en heeft een hoge weerstand tegen slijtage door de 
dikke buitendraden maar is daardoor ook tamelijk stijf De vuldraadconstructie filler is heeft dunnere buitendraden 
dan de Sealeconstructie en is daardoor beter bestand tegen sterke buigingen De binnenlaag rond de 
kern bestaat daarbij uit minimaal draden met een buitenlaag van tweemaal zoveel draden De ruimte 
tussen de binnen en buitenlaag wordt daarbij opgevuld met dunne draden Bij dunne kabels kunnen 
de vuldraden erg dun worden en daarmee kwetsbaar In de Warringtonconstructie heeft de buitenlaag het 
dubbele aantal draden waarvan de helft van de draden is dunner dan de andere De 
WarringtonSealeconstructie combineert de Seale en Warringtonconstructie De eerste laag bestaat hierbij uit minimaal draden met 
daaromheen een tweede laag de Warringtonlaag met het dubbele aantal draden afwisselend dik en dun 
De derde laag heeft evenveel draden als de tweede maar deze zijn van gelijke dikte 
Door de drie lagen kan de inwendige wrijving iets groter zijn Zeer hoogwaardige staalkabels worden 
aan de buitenkant soms in een ronde vorm geperst Geperste kabels bieden betere prestaties in 
vergelijking met conventionele kabelconstructies Deze kabels hebben een hogere breekkracht een betere vulling een grotere 
flexibiliteit en een betere contactlijn met schijven dan vergelijkbare conventionele kabels Er zijn twee soorten 
samengeperste kabels met verdichte strengen compacted strands en geperste kabels swaged wire ropes Verdichte strengen 
worden geproduceerd door conventionele strengen gemaakt van ronde draden door een trekijzer te persen Dit 
vervormt de draden gedeeltelijk vermindert de strengdiameter en egaliseert het oppervlak Persen kan ook worden 
toegepast nadat de kabel is vervaardigd Hierbij wordt de gehele kabelomtrek gecomprimeerd waardoor de individuele 
oppervlaktedraden vlak worden en gaten tussen de strengen sluiten De strengen worden op hun beurt 
in een spiraal of schroeflijnvorm rond de kern geslagen De slagrichting kan daarbij rechts right 
hand RH of links left hand LH in kruisslag regular of ordinary lay RL of 
OL in langslag lang lay LL zijn afwisselend om en om alternate lay en afwisselend 
twee om een special alternate lay Als een kabel niet nader wordt gespecificeerd dan betreft 
het een rechtse kruisslag Een rechtse en linkse kabel dienen niet aan elkaar verbonden te 
worden onder kracht aangezien deze elkaar zullen uitdraaien Bij kruisslag liggen de draden evenwijdig aan 
de as van de kabel Dit wordt bereikt door de slagrichting van de strengen tegengesteld 
te maken aan de slagrichting van de draden in de strengen Dit type slag heeft 
een goede knik en draaiweerstand en is goed bestand tegen vervorming Bij de Langslag is 
liggen de draden dwars op de kabelas door de slagrichting van de strengen gelijk te 
maken aan de slagrichting van de draden Dit type slag biedt meer weerstand tegen slijtage 
en flexibeler maar draait sneller uit Zodra een kabel op trek wordt belast zal deze 
een moment ondervinden in een richting tegenovergesteld aan de slagrichting en dus willen uitdraaien Bij 
een draaiarme kabel zijn de verschillende lagen in tegengestelde richting geslagen waarbij de momenten van 
de links geslagen laag die van de rechts geslagen laag ten dele opheft Nadeel is 
dat er puntcontacten bij de draadkruisingen zijn met extra buiging en grote plaatselijke dwarsbelasting tot 
gevolg Dit geeft meer slijtage en kan daardoor een kortere levensduur tot gevolg hebben Ook 
draaiarme constructies zullen enige draaiing ondervinden De treksterkte van een kabel is afhankelijk van de 
sterkte van de individuele strengen en van de vullingsgraad van de kabel Er zijn verschillende 
manieren om staalkabels te slaan zogenaamde langslag of dwarsslagkabels waardoor een betere vullingsgraad te bereiken 
is maar ook vragen sommige toepassingen om bijzondere opbouw van de staalkabel Smering vermindert de 
interne wrijving tussen de draden en strengen en de externe wrijving met trommel en schijven 
bij lopend werk Tijdens de productie worden staalkabels dan ook al voorzien van vet Naast 
deze smerende werking heeft het vet ook een conserverende werking ie de bescherming tegen roestvorming 
Bij een geïmpregneerde vezelkern kan deze gedurende de levensduur de kabel nog smeren Het vet 
gaat echter vooral bij lopend werk na verloop van tijd verloren zodat smering gedurende het 
gebruik de levensduur kan verlengen De gebruikte smering moet dan wel doordringen tot in de 
kern van de kabel Het moet ook voldoende adhesie hebben om zo aan de kabel 
te blijven kleven Zodra er echter corrosie en draadbreuken zijn opgetreden dan is vervanging de 
enige optie Smering zou dan namelijk juist de frictie verminderen die mogelijk de draad nog 
bij elkaar houdt ondanks de draadbreuken Een plotselinge kabelbreuk zou dan het gevolg kunnen zijn 
Voor hef en hijsmiddelen is een periodieke visuele inspectie verplicht dus ook voor staalkabels die 
gebruikt worden bij hijswerk Dit is veelal jaarlijks in het Verenigd Koninkrijk zelfs halfjaarlijks Voor 
België gebeurt dit op basis van van het ARAB en dienen kabels voor hijswerkzaamheden om 
de maanden gekeurd te worden door een EDTC Om aan te geven dat een hijsmiddel 
geïnspecteerd is wordt wel gebruikgemaakt van een jaarkleurensysteem Dit kan een systeem zijn op basis 
van de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie maar er kan ook een eigen systeem worden gebruikt Bij 
staalkabels wordt de markering veelal aangebracht op de eindverbinding Staalkabels kunnen uitwendig gecontroleerd worden door 
met een dot poetskatoen langs de kabel te lopen Bij iedere breuk blijft een pluisje 
hangen Bij te veel draadbreuken moet de kabel afgekeurd worden Een deel van de kabel 
kan ook door middel van destructief testen worden onderzocht Kabels kunnen verder nietdestructief met een 
elektronisch meetinstrument in en uitwendig worden gecontroleerd Door deze elektronische controle kan de toegestane veilige 
levensduur van de kabel behoorlijk worden verlengd Wanneer kabels buiten gebruik moeten worden gesteld is 
afhankelijk van de toepassing Bij hijskranen geeft ISO de nodige criteria zoals draadbreuken kinken kurkentrekkers 
vogelkooien slijtage en corrosie Zogenaamde kurkentrekkers komen vooral voor bij draden met een vezelkern Door 
slijtage van de kern dringt een van de draden steeds verder naar binnen tot deze 
in zijn geheel de plaats van de vezelkern inneemt Dit lijkt dan op een kurkentrekker 
Bij een zogenaamde vogelkooi liggen de strengen van de buitenlaag volledig los van de rest 
van de kabel en vormen als het ware een vogelkooi Om een staalkabel te kunnen 
gebruiken moet deze vastgemaakt kunnen worden aan het te hijsen te slepen of te trekken 
voorwerp Om kracht over te brengen zijn eindverbindingen nodig De gebruikte verbindingstechnieken berusten alle op 
wrijving of hechting maar daarbij zijn vele verschillende eindverbindingen mogelijk Zo kan de eindverbinding uit 
de draad zelf bestaan waarbij deze in een lus of oog wordt teruggeslagen Deze kunnen 
ook worden uitgevoerd met een kous in het oog Er kan ook een huis of

SanktStephanikirche; Sunte Steffen  Duitsland De SintStefanuskerk Duits SanktStephanikirche; Nedersaksisch Sunte Steffen is een protestantse parochiekerk 
in het westelijk deel van het historische centrum van Bremen De kerk vormt het stedenbouwkundig 
middelpunt van het naar de kerk vernoemde Stephaniviertel een wijk die in de Tweede Wereldoorlog 
volledig werd verwoest De kerk werd rond door aartsbisschop Adalbert I gesticht op de Steffensberg 
een voor de stadspoorten gelegen verhoging op een zandrug In verhief aartsbisschop Adalbert II de 
kerk tot stifts en parochiekerk In eerste instantie droeg de kerk het patrocinium van de 
twee heiligen SintWillehadus en SintStefanus; pas later zette zich de naam SintStefanuskerk door Na een 
brand in de eeuw werd de kerk vernieuwd Tegen het einde van de eeuw vond 
er een verbouwing tot een hallenkerk plaats Sinds drukt de slanke neogotische toren een stempel 
op het aanzien van de kerk De gemeente van de Stefanuskerk wist in de nationaalsocialistische 
periode de invloed van de zogenaamde Duitse christenen te weerstaan In werd er een broederraad 
van twee vrouwen en drie mannen opgericht die zich tot de Bekennende Kirche rekenden De 
beide pastors van de kerk en veel gemeenteleden sloten zich hierbij aan Tijdens het nachtelijk 
bombardement van en augustus op Bremen werd de Stefanuskerk sterk beschadigd Na de oorlog werd 
het noordelijke zijschip van het middenschip gescheiden en als kerk in gebruik genomen Het middenschip 
werd tussen en onder leiding van de architect Arthur Bothe nieuw opgebouwd Het zuidelijke schip 
niet meer werd hersteld terwijl de oostelijke zijschiptraveeën in een transept werden veranderd De eveneens 
zwaar beschadigde zuidelijke toren werd met een vereenvoudigde spits herbouwd Op de vooravond van Kerstmis 
werden in drie nieuwe bronzen klokken met de namen Schöpfung slagtoon d′ Frieden slagtoon e′ 
en Gerechtigkeit slagtoon g′ ingeluid Door verwoestingen en verbouwingen is er van de inrichting van 
de kerk weinig over gebleven Van de orgelkas uit een van de mooiste van alle 
Bremer kerken zijn slechts brokstukken over Het huidige orgel dateert uit en werd door de 
orgelbouwer Beckerath uit Hamburg gebouwd Drie fraaie kroonluchters van messing uit de en vroege eeuw 
konden worden gered Het aantal gemeenteleden is sinds de jaren geslonken van naar personen Met 
name de ontvolking van de binnenstad en de trek naar Bremer voorsteden heeft aan deze 
drastische daling bijgedragen De Stefanuskerk raakte op januari de status van een zelfstandige gemeente kwijt 
toen de gemeente fuseerde met de SintMichaëlkerk Alhoewel de kerk voor alles een godshuis is 
presenteert de Stefanuskerk zich tegenwoordig ook als cultuurkerk Er worden veel tentoonstellingen en concerten van 
kerkmuziek georganiseerd Het aan de kerk verbonden StStephanikoor is een van de oudste en grootste

Catenaccio is een voornamelijk in Italië toegepaste speelstijl in het voetbal Catenaccio is het Italiaanse 
woord voor 'grendel' Het is dan ook een systeem dat zich vooral richt op een 
goed georganiseerde en effectieve verdediging die de aanvallen van de opponenten moet neutraliseren Het is 
een combinatie van een verdediging van vier mandekkers in lijn ondersteund door een libero in 
Nederland ook wel 'laatste man' genoemd Het systeem is bekend geworden doordat de Argentijnse coach 
Helenio Herrera bij Internazionale er veel gebruik van maakte in de jaren zestig Inter won 
in die tijd dan ook geregeld wedstrijden met uitslagen als of met weinig tegendoelpunten Het 
catenacciosysteem werd erg beïnvloed door een tactiek van de voormalige Oostenrijkse coach Karl Rappan genaamd 
"verrou" Frans voor Als bondscoach van Zwitserland in de jaren dertig en veertig had Rappan 
dit systeem ingevoerd Achter de verdediger werd nog een extra voetballer neergezet genaamd de verrouilleur 
Deze speler was extreem defensief ingesteld en speelde maar net voor de doelman In de 
jaren vijftig werd deze tactiek verder uitgewerkt door Nereo Rocco die coach van Padova Calcio 
Inter nam de speelstijl later over Rappans verrousysteem werd uitgevoerd door een viermans defensie met 
daarbij een libero achter drie 'normale' verdedigers Daarnaast was er sprake van een strikte mandekking 
een spelmaker in het midden en daarnaast twee buitenste middenvelders Ten slotte waren er twee 
spitsen met een aanvallende middenvelder daarachter Het systeem van Rocco ook weleens het 'eerste echte' 
catenaccio genoemd werd bekend toen hij in werkzaam was bij US Triestina Hij speelde voornamelijk 
met een en speelde erg defensief Met deze catenaccio werd de club verrassend tweede in 
de Serie A De belangrijkste verandering die toegepast werd op de catenaccio was het toevoegen 
van een libero "vrije" verdediger die in het Nederlands ook bekend is als laatste De 
rol van deze speler was het oppikken van verloren ballen en eventueel te helpen met 
dubbele mandekking Een andere innovatie was de snelle counteraanval vooral door lange ballen vanuit de 
In de versie van Herrera in de jaren zestig werden de vier mandekkers zorgvuldig de 
opdracht gegeven de dekking van één aanvaller op zich te nemen Achter die vier verdedigers 
speelde dan nog de libero die iedere afvallende bal moest oppikken Door de nadruk te 
leggen op de defensie heeft Italië door de jaren veel verdedigers van wereldklasse voortgebracht zoals 
Franco Baresi Paolo Maldini en Fabio Cannavaro Herrera claimde kort voor zijn dood echter nog 
dat mensen zijn tactiek te verdedigend onthouden hebben Hij zei dat 'het probleem is dat 
mensen die mij gekopieerd hebben dat verkeerd gedaan hebben Ze zijn vergeten de aanvallende aspecten 
van mijn catenaccio over te nemen Ik had Picchi als libero ja maar ik had 
ook Facchetti de eerste vleugelverdediger die zoveel scoorde als een Het catenaccio van Herrera was 
echter verre van perfect zo liet Rinus Michels zien met zijn totaalvoetbal Bij het totaalvoetbal 
heeft niemand een vaste positie; van alle spelers wordt verwacht de taken van een aanvaller 
middenvelder en verdediger te kunnen vervullen Mandekking wordt daarom onmogelijk geacht tegen een dergelijk systeem 
AFC Ajax de club van coach Michels won in de Europacup Ifinale van Internazionale met 
twee doelpunten Johan Cruijff en het Algemeen Dagblad sprak over 'de vernietiging van het defensieve 
In herhaalde Ajax dit kunstje om van het defensieve AC Milan te winnen in de 
strijd om de Europese Supercup De ploeg van coach Cesare Maldini ging met liefst de 
boot in het Amsterdamse Olympisch Stadion Als er gespeeld wordt met pure zonale verdediging dan 
heeft iedere verdediger en middenvelder een bepaald deel van het veld dat het zelf moet 
dekken Bij catenaccio was er echter sprake van mandekking; soms werd zelfs dubbele dekking toegepast 
bij erg sterke Tegen het totaalvoetbal was dat echter onbegonnen werk gezien het feit dat 
aanvallers hielpen verdedigen en verdedigers aanvallen wat het erg moeilijk dekken maakt Enzo Bearzot bondscoach 
van Italië kwam echter met een oplossing Zona Mista Italiaans voor 'gemengde zone' Het was 
een combinatie van de kracht van zonale dekking en de sterke punten van het Bij 
Zona Mista ook bekend als Il gioco all'Italiana 'Het spel in Italiaanse stijl' is er 
sprake van een defensie van vier verdedigers Een libero speelt vrij voor de doelman en 
ondersteunt de centrale verdedigers bij hun taken Er speelt een vleugelverdediger meestal aan de linkerkant 
die er offensief speelt en vaak bijna een middenvelder is Op het middenveld spelen drie 
spelers in het midden namelijk een verdedigende middenvelder een centrale middenvelder en een spelmaker Aan 
de kant waar de back niet speelt meestal dus de rechterkant is nog een flankspeler 
die soms als extra aanvaller speelt Voorin staan twee spitsen Een centrale spits staat bij 
het strafschopgebied om voor doelpunten te zorgen en een schaduwspits speelt om hem heen om 
in de ruimtes te spelen Tijdens het einde van de jaren zeventig en het begin 
van de jaren tachtig was Zona Mista de dominante tactiek in het Italiaanse voetbal en 
tijdens het WK beleefde het Italiaans voetbalelftal grote successen door de wereldtitel binnen te Gaetano 
Scirea speelde als libero Fulvio Collovati en Claudio Gentile als centrale verdedigers Antonio Cabrini als 
vleugelverdediger Gabriele Oriali als verdedigende middenvelder Marco Tardelli als centrale middenvelder Giancarlo Antognoni als spelmaker 
en Paolo Rossi als diepe spits Zona Mista verloor echter aan populariteit en steeds minder 
werd de tactiek toegepast Volgens de Italiaanse journalist Ludovico Maradei 'speelden alle teams met hetzelfde 
systeem' en 'was het erg voorspelbaar doordat iedereen mandekking Hamburger SV toonde deze uitspraken aan 
door in in de Europacup Ifinale met een zeer verdedigende tactiek met te winnen van 
Juventus dat grotendeels bestond uit de spelers die met Italië wereldkampioen waren In het hedendaagse 
voetbal is vrijwel geen sprake meer van het 'echte' catenaccio Bij de meeste tactieken worden 
mandekking en het gebruik van de libero niet meer toegepast Een zeer defensieve speelstijl wordt 
vaak nog wel catenaccio genoemd maar meestal wordt er wel met een ander systeem gespeeld 
wat afgeleid is van het catenaccio Tegenwoordig wordt er steeds meer met zonale verdediging gespeeld 
in plaats van De libero is bijna in zijn totaliteit verdwenen Teams gebruiken liever een 
extra speler op een andere plaats in het Er wordt veel gedacht dat catenaccio veel 
gebruikt wordt in het Italiaanse voetbal In de Serie A spelen de clubs vaker volgens 
een of Cesare Prandelli speelt met of met het Italiaans voetbalelftal waar zijn voorgangers Cesare 
Maldini en Giovanni Trapattoni catenaccio wel zonder succes weliswaar Maldini verloor met Italië in de 
kwartfinales van het WK waar Trapattoni vier jaar later tweede ronde en tijdens het EK 
eerste ronde ook geen succes behaalde Catenaccio behaalde ook zeker wel zijn succes in de 
modernere tijden Trapattoni wist de tactiek succesvol toe te passen toen hij als coach van 
SL Benfica in de Portugese landstitel binnenhaalde De Duitse coach Otto Rehhagel won met zijn 
defensieve aanpak met Griekenland het EK waar zijn team als underdog aanwezig Ook bereikte Dino

De Tuin van Kapitein Rommel is een natuurtuin met ontmoetingsruimte in Castricum in de Nederlandse 
provincie NoordHolland De tuin is eigendom van de gemeente Castricum en is in zijn huidige 
vorm aangelegd in met een ecologische en sociale functie Hierbij werd voortgebouwd op de inrichting 
door de vorige eigenaar kapitein Albert Rommel De tuin was in zijn tijd al opengesteld 
voor de bewoners van Castricum en wordt nu grotendeels beheerd door vrijwilligers van de Stichting 
Tuin van Kapitein Rommel De tuin en een replica van het oorspronkelijke tuinhuis staan op 
de lijst van gemeentelijke monumenten in De huidige tuin hoorde oorspronkelijk bij de villa Sonnevanck 
aan de Burgemeester Mooijstraat waar de ouders van Albert Rommel in kwamen wonen Zijn invloed 
op de tuin stamt vooral uit de jaren na toen hij een 'pomphuis' in de 
tuin van zijn moeder liet bouwen waar hij met zijn tweede echtgenote ging wonen Hij 
liet onder meer de grote vijver aanleggen waarin veel vis werd uitgezet Ook liet hij 
een rotspartij met cascade aanleggen De begroeiing bestond uit sierplanten een boomgaard en een groentetuin 
en er werden veel dieren gehouden De tuin was zijn lust en zijn leven na 
een loopbaan als stuurman en kapitein in de koopvaardij Voor zijn "waardevolle diensten aan de 
oorlogvoering" kreeg hij in het Kruis van verdienste "Kapitein Rommel" was een markante Castricummer die 
dorpsgenoten liet meegenieten van zijn tuin en er ook kinderen liet Na zijn dood werden 
de tuin en het pomphuiswoonhuis in eigendom van de gemeente in verband met plannen om 
er een stationsplein aan te leggen Het woonhuis werd later verkocht Het tuinhuis uit met 
karakteristieke detailleringen was in slechte staat Het werd weggehaald om te laten restaureren en werd 
in elders in Castricum met een iets andere dakconstructie herbouwd Bij de renovatie zijn alleen 
de verrotte onderdelen gedeeltelijk vervangen waardoor de bouwkundige staat achteruit bleef gaan In werd geconstateerd 
dat renovatie duurder zou zijn dan nieuwbouw In waren de meeste onderdelen door houtrot aangetast; 
wat nog goed was waaronder de hekjes werd in depot gebracht Een replica met enkele 
originele onderdelen is in in de heringerichte tuin teruggeplaatst Het tuinhuis replica staat op de 
monumentenlijst van de gemeente Castricum samen met de tuin waarmee het een cultuurhistorisch waardevol ensemble 
De tuin was in een verwaarloosde boomgaard en de vijver dichtgegroeid De gemeenteraad nam in 
het initiatief om er een milieunatuurtuin met ontmoetingsruimte van te maken De gemeente stelde het 
terrein beschikbaar en er kwam geld van het rijk voor sociale projecten In samenwerking met 
een tuinarchitect werd een inrichtings en beheerplan gemaakt In werd de Stichting Tuin van Kapitein 
Rommel opgericht om het plan te realiseren De uitvoering werd zoveel mogelijk gedaan met vrijwilligers 
Op juni werd de heringerichte "Tuin van Kapitein Rommel" Bij de inrichting van de huidige 
tuin stonden de sociale functie en de ecologische functie voorop Er was behoefte aan een 
sociale ontmoetingsplaats waar door verschillende groepen kan worden samengewerkt Voor de ecologische functie was een 
verscheidenheid aan biotopen gewenst Dit zou ook mogelijkheden bieden voor natuureducatie en voor beheer door 
vrijwilligers De tuin is ha groot waarvan de vijver ongeveer een derde uitmaakt Het gebied 
bestaat uit oude duinzandgronden en is lang als tuinbouwgebied gebruikt Hierdoor is de bodem humus 
en voedselrijk geworden De vijver stond oorspronkelijk in verbinding met de Stationsvijver maar wordt nu 
vooral door regenwater gevoed Het water is vrij voedselrijk De spontane vegetatie van de tuin 
en de vijver bestond dan ook uit algemene soorten van voedselrijke milieus en was weinig 
Het ecologisch ontwerp leidde tot diverse veranderingen in de tuin Om de variatie in het 
grasland te verbeteren is hooilandbeheer met verschraling toegepast Door plaatselijk afgraven van grond ontstonden geschikte 
milieus voor schraal nat grasland Elders is kalkrijk voedselarm zand aangebracht om een droge schrale 
graslandvegetatie te krijgen In het grasland komen onder meer koekoeksbloem veldzuring hertshooi walstro duinviooltje en 
muizenoor voor De vijver is uitgebaggerd en de watercirculatie verbeterd waarbij de rotspartij met cascade 
weer een functie kreeg In de vijver en langs de beek zijn plasbermen met voedselarm 
zand aangelegd om de variatie in oevermilieus te vergroten voor oever riet en moerasvegetaties Bloemrijk 
inheems struweel is aangeplant als voedselbron voor insecten en vogels Het inheemse bosje met zwarte 
els hazelaar en ruwe berk heeft een dichtere structuur gekregen om nestgelegenheid voor zangvogels als 
heggenmus winterkoning en roodborst te verbeteren Ook is een bosje aangelegd waarin stinsenplanten als daslook 
bosanemoon winterakoniet kievitsbloem en sterhyacint De sociale functie is gericht op diverse doelgroepen binnen Castricum 
zoals mensen zonder werk mensen met een handicap buurtbewoners mensen van een zorgcomplex en Hiervoor 
zijn onder meer een ontmoetingscentrum en een plantenkas gebouwd en is een kruidentuin aangelegd Aan 
de herinrichting van de tuin hebben ongeveer twintig vrijwilligers In de tuin en het ontmoetingscentrum 
worden ook culturele activiteiten georganiseerd zoals tentoonstellingen en muziekuitvoeringen De tuin vervult een voorbeeldfunctie voor 
mensen die onbekend zijn met ecologisch beheer De tuin werkt grotendeels met vrijwilligers die worden 
begeleid door een coördinatoractiviteitenbegeleider en een De sociale functie van de tuin is in de 
loop der jaren gegroeid Jaarlijks bezoeken rond mensen de tuin voor een van de culturele 
of recreatieve evenementen zoals het pompoenenconcert of de kerstmarkt Ruim basisschoolleerlingen doen in het voorjaar 
mee aan een natuurontdekkingstocht In de zomer bezoeken kinderen het jaarlijkse evenement Sprookjestuin Rond kleuters

Groep In viel uiteindelijk het doek voor de Het eerste exemplaar van de werd op 
de AutobusRAI in gepresenteerd De bus was gebouwd op een DAF en was daarmee een 
semilagevloersbus Dit wil zeggen dat de bus kon knielen maar dat er nog steeds een 
opstap was om de bus in te komen Het prototype was gestoken in de kleuren 
grijswit en rood Deze kleuren zouden later toegepast worden op de stadsbussen van de Zuidooster 
voor de stadsdiensten van Eindhoven en Venlo Na afloop van de AutobusRAI werd het prototype 
verkocht aan de RET De bus werd later in de huisstijlkleuren van dit bedrijf geschilderd 
en deed nog tot en met ongeveer dienst In ging de in serieproductie Van het 
oorspronkelijke concept werden enkele series stadsbussen geleverd aan de Zuidooster en het autobusbedrijf van de 
luchthaven Schiphol De Zuidooster bestelde ook nog een serie streekbussen op basis van de Nog 
in de loop van werd de kop van de door designbureau Duvedec opnieuw ontworpen Dit

Kėdainiai Duits Kedahnen Pools Kiejdany is een stad in het midden van Litouwen in het 
district Kaunas De stad is gelegen aan het riviertje de Nevėžis en heeft inwoners De 
gelijknamige gemeente heeft inwoners Kėdainiai werd voor het eerst genoemd in en werd in de 
eeuw als stad aangeduid Officieel kreeg de stad in stadsrechten Kėdainiai was het centrum van 
de hervorming in Litouwen; tegenwoordig staat er nog een lutherse kerk De oude binnenstad is 
goed bewaard gebleven Er staan verschillende kastelen en herenhuizen van de Litouwse adel die tegenwoordig 
vooral als openbaar gebouw worden gebruikt Naast de lutherse kerk die uit dateert zijn er 
aan kerkgebouwen onder meer de houten St Jozefkerk Šv Juozapo bažnyčia en twee synagogen In 
het noorden van de stad bevindt zich een minaret een curiositeit in een stad zonder 
moslims Het bouwwerk dateert uit en werd door landeigenaar Eduard Totleben gebouwd ter herinnering aan 
de RussischTurkse Oorlog waaraan hij had deelgenomen Evangelische kerk Houten kerk St Joseph Synagogen in 
Het plicht doen was door de eeuwen heen tot circa een dagelijks religieus samenzijn van 
de bemanning aan boord van veel Nederlandse Op de voormalige sloepen en haringloggers kende men 
voor de bemanning een leef en slaapruimte die in het voorschip was aangebracht Daar werd 
ook gekookt De schipper had met zijn stuurman en de motordrijver een eigen ruimte in 
het achterschip Het eten werd echter gezamenlijk gebruikt in de ruimte in het voorschip Schipper 
stuurman en motordrijver voegden zich dan bij de overigen Aangezien vissers van oudsher gelovige rechtlijnige 
lieden waren beleden zij hun geloof onder meer door te bidden vóór en te danken 
ná het eten Omdat in de late namiddag de netten in zee waren gezet en 
nog geruime tijd in zee bleven 'staan' gaf dit de schipper de mogelijkheid om na 
het avondeten plicht te Het lezen van de bijbel na het eten zoals dat thuis 
regel was werd aan boord vervangen door het voorlezen uit een – in visserskringen gangbaar 
– werk De Godvreezende Zeeman van Nicolaas Simonsz van Het religieuze boekwerk droeg een geschiedenis 
mee van honderden jaren en had een grote bekendheid onder het gelovige vissersvolk In De 
Godvreezende Zeeman trof men tekstgedeelten die overeenkwamen met preken zoals die in de protestantse kerken 
waren te beluisteren zij het dat de duur van de teksten uit het voornoemde boekje 
aanzienlijk korter waren Echter kon het zo kort niet zijn of sommige vissers dommelden in 
het benauwde warme voorin weg Na de lezing werd meestal een psalmlied gezongen waarbij de 
keus viel op een meer bekend psalmlied zodat allen konden meezingen Omdat de jeugdige vissers 
niet in staat waren het reguliere catechisatieonderwijs aan de wal bij te wonen voelde een 
schipper zich vaak geroepen de jongeren een stukje tekst op te geven uit een religieus 
– zo geheten – catechisatieboekje zoals dit aan de wal door predikanten voor de jeugd 
werd gehanteerd Enkele dagen later moest zo'n jongere tijdens het plicht doen zijn tekst voor 
de schipper opzeggen Wanneer in hun nabijheid op de visgronden verzorgde het hospitaalkerkschip voor de 
bemanningen van rondom liggende schepen een kerkdienst in zijn kerkzaaltje Dergelijke diensten konden ook door 
de vissersgezinnen aan de wal via de radio worden beluisterd Menig passant kon dan ook 
op zondagen worden verrast door de trage zware kerkzang van de vissers ter zee welke 
opklonk uit de visserswoningen in de Noordzeedorpen en de Waren de schepen aan het begin 
van de in de directe omgeving van de Shetlandse havenplaats Lerwick dan konden de vissers 
aan de wal de – speciaal voor hen verzorgde Nederlandstalige – kerkdiensten bijwonen Predikanten uit 
Hollandse vissersdorpen en steden gingen voor in dergelijke diensten De baai waaraan Lerwick lag was 
dan geheel gevuld met vissersschepen Nadat de haringvisserij met de vleet na geschiedenis was geworden

oblast Smolensk en heeft ruim inwoners De beschermheilige van de stad is de heilige Abraham 
van Smolensk De stad is genoemd naar de rivier de Smolnja maar de oorsprong van 
die naam is minder duidelijk Mogelijk is deze ontstaan uit het woord smola dat teer 
of hars betekent In de regio groeien veel naaldbomen; het was daarom een belangrijk verwerkingscentrum 
van hars Een alternatieve verklaring zou kunnen zijn de verwantschap met het Slavische woord smol 
dat 'donkere grond' betekent De stad ligt in Europees Rusland aan de oevers van de

het geschrift De Administrando Imperio van de Byzantijnse keizer Constantijn VII waarin Smolensk als een 
belangrijk fort van de Roes werd genoemd In werd het vorstendom van Smolensk gesticht Vanwege 
de strategische positie tussen Polen Litouwen en Moskou groeide de stad snel Aan het einde 
van de twaalfde eeuw was het vorstendom een van de machtigste in OostEuropa welke Kiev 
vaak overschaduwde In die tijd werden vele kerken gebouwd in Smolensk De belangrijkste zijn de 
kerk van de heilige Petrus en Paulus uit herbouwd na oorlogsschade de kerk van Johannes 
de Doper ook deels herbouwd en de Svirskaja origineel volgens tijdgenoten het mooiste gebouw ten 
oosten van Kiev Smolensk werd in de eeuw steeds meer een pion in de machtsstrijd 
tussen Litouwen en Moskou Vytautas de Grote nam de stad in in en De stad 
werd ingelijfd in het vorstendom Litouwen Sommige Russisch gezinde edelen vluchtten naar Moskou anderen gingen 
naar Vilnius Met een bevolking van enkele tienduizenden was Smolensk de grootste stad in het 
vorstendom Het leverde drie regimenten voor de slag bij Grunwald waar Vytautas de Duitse Orde 
versloeg In werd Smolensk ingenomen door Vasili III van Moskou Om deze gebeurtenis te eren 
werd in Moskou het Novodevitsjiklooster gesticht dat aan de icoon van de Madonna van Smolensk 
is gewijd Tsaar Boris Godoenov versterkte de stad laat in de eeuw om de Polen 
en Litouwers terug te dringen Het stenen kremlin gebouwd tussen en is het grootste van 
Rusland met opmerkelijk dikke muren en vele wachttorens Desondanks werd de stad in door het 
PoolsLitouwse Gemenebest ingenomen na een maanden durende belegering bekend als de Strijd van Smolensk In 
probeerde Moskou Smolensk weer in te nemen tijdens de Smolenskoorlog maar de Russische troepen werden 
verslagen door Władysław IV van Polen hetgeen tot het Verdrag van Poljanovka in leidde In 
werd Smolensk weer ingenomen door de Russen nadat het PoolsLitouwse gemenebest zwaar te lijden had 
gehad van een burgeroorlog Chmelnytskyopstand en een invasie van Zweden Zweedse Zondvloed Door zijn al 
eerder genoemde strategische ligging is Smolensk altijd het toneel geweest van hevige veldslagen In kwam 
Napoleon bij Smolensk aan waar de Eerste Slag bij Smolensk plaatsvond Deze slag gewonnen door 
Napoleon is later door Lev Tolstoj in zijn roman Oorlog en Vrede beschreven In totaal 
verloren ongeveer man het leven Na de Russische Revolutie en de Vrede van BrestLitovsk werd 
Smolensk opgeeist door de WitRussische Nationale Republiek In werd deze bezet door de Russische Sovjetrepubliek 
Op januari werd in Smolensk de WitRussische Sovjetrepubliek uitgeroepen Later werd Smolensk aan de Russische 
Sovjetrepubliek toegekend In de Tweede Wereldoorlog was Smolensk in weer het toneel van een grote

De Sri Lankaanse Burgeroorlog was een burgeroorlog tussen Tamils en Singalezen in Sri Lanka die 
woedde van tot personen kwamen om in het conflict en circa werden uit hun woningen 
verdreven De Tamiltijgers streden voor de onafhankelijke staat Tamil Eelam De Singalezen zijn hoofdzakelijk boeddhisten 
en de Tamils hindoes Sri Lanka voorheen bekend als Ceylon is een republiek op het 
Indiase subcontinent Het land heeft iets meer dan miljoen inwoners op een oppervlakte van km² 
keer Nederland Hoofdstad van Sri Lanka is de stad Sri Jayewardenapura Kotte Het merendeel procent 
van de bevolking is Singalees Een minderheid procent van de bevolking is Tamil Bijna elke 
bevolkingsgroep in Sri Lanka komt oorspronkelijk uit India De Singalezen vestigden zich op het eiland 
in de eeuw vChr Later in de eeuw vChr stichtten de Singalezen een koninkrijk op 
het eiland De steden Anuradhapura vChr tot nChr en Polonnaruwa tot nChr waren het centrum 
van bloeiende boeddhistische koninkrijken Ook de Tamils emigreerden vanuit India naar Sri Lanka Zij stichtten 
in de eeuw een koninkrijk in het noorden van het land Het gebied in het 
noorden en oosten van Sri Lanka werd het ‘thuisland’ van de Tamils Nog steeds wonen 
de Tamils vooral in dat gebied In sloot de VOC een bondgenootschap met het Singalese 
koninkrijk van Kandy In bezetten de Engelsen Sri Lanka om te voorkomen dat het eiland 
in Franse handen viel – Nederland was toen een vazalstaat van het napoleontische Frankrijk De 
Engelsen stichtten plantages in het binnenland om koffie thee en kokos te verbouwen Hiervoor werden 
veel arbeidskrachten uit India geïmporteerd Dit waren voornamelijk Indiase Tamils Om hun gezag te handhaven 
probeerden de Engelsen bevolkingsgroepen tegen elkaar uit te spelen De geïmporteerde Tamils waren betrekkelijk eenvoudig 
onder de duim te houden Om aan de Singalese meerderheid een tegenwicht te bieden zorgden 
de Engelsen voor goed onderwijs aan de Tamilminderheid in het noorden van het land De 
Tamilminderheid kreeg zo een dominante positie in het bestuur ten opzichte van de Singalese meerderheid 
Ook hadden zij vaak betere banen dan de Singalezen Zelfs in het zuiden en westen 
van het land – het gebied waar voornamelijk Singalezen wonen – kregen de Tamils de 
beste posities toebedeeld De Tamils voerden ook de executiebevelen van de Britten uit die uitgevaardigd 
waren tegen Singalese verzetsstrijders Dit wakkerde het nationalisme onder de Singalezen aan Ze begonnen hun 
gezamenlijke geschiedenis te benadrukken Als gevolg van het nationalisme begonnen de Singalezen zich steeds agressiever 
af te zetten tegen de koloniale overheerser en de bevolkingsgroep die profiteerde van de Engelse 
kolonisatie de Tamils Na de onafhankelijkheid in werkten de bevolkingsgroepen aanvankelijk samen Alleen de Indiase 
Tamils die op de plantages werkten vielen hierbuiten De regering ontnam de Indiase Tamils hun 
burgerrechten ze mochten bijvoorbeeld niet stemmen Dit beperkte de invloed van de Tamils in de 
politiek In jaren werden wetten aangenomen die Sri Lanka ‘singaliseerden’ Engels werd vervangen door Singalees 
en de goede baantjes bij de overheid werden vanaf nu ingenomen door Singalezen Deze ontwikkeling 
ging steeds verder en de Tamils ontwikkelden een sterk natiebewustzijn De roep om een eigen 
staat werd steeds luider In werden The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Tamiltijgers een gewapende 
groepering opgericht De Tamiltijgers pleegden terreuraanslagen op Singalese doelwitten De regering nam een antiterrorismewet aan 
en arresteerde veel Tamiljeugd De terreur van Tamiltijgers was mede veroorzaakt door terreur van Singalezen 
jegens de Tamils Toen de Tamils nog goede posities hadden in de regering werden veel 
Tamils vermoord door Singalezen en werden velen verdreven naar het noorden In werd de politieke 
partij van de Tamils – de TULF – verbannen uit het parlement waardoor de Tamils 
niet meer vertegenwoordigd waren Dit leidde tot onlusten en burgerlijke ongehoorzaamheid in de gebieden waar 
de Tamils de meerderheid hadden vooral in het noorden De regering reageerde hierop door meer 
Singalese soldaten naar het noorden te zenden In pleegden militante Tamils een aanslag op regeringssoldaten 
In Jaffna een stad in het noorden van Sri Lanka werden soldaten gedood Dit veroorzaakte 
een golf van geweld in het hele land Tamils en hun bezittingen werden aangevallen door 
Singalese burgers Deze burgers hadden zich verenigd in kleine gewelddadige groepen die Tamils vermoordden en 
huizen van Tamils platbrandden Na drie dagen slaagde de regering erin de rust te laten 
wederkeren In die drie dagen waren duizenden Tamils op de vlucht geslagen naar India en 
werden er nog eens duizenden gedood de regering spreekt over de Tamils over doden In 
de jaren tachtig en negentig ontstond een patroon de Tamiltijgers pleegden zelfmoordaanslagen die leidden tot 
vergeldingsacties van de regeringstroepen In het begin van de oorlog waren er verschillende groepen van 
militante Tamils vaak jongeren maar de Tamiltijgers zien zichzelf als de enige vertegenwoordiger van de 
Tamils De kleinere groepen werden gedwongen zich aan te sluiten bij de Tamiltijgers en zij 
die niet loyaal waren aan de Tamiltijgers werden vermoord Deze groepering groeide uit tot een 
internationaal netwerk Later in de jaren werden sommige discriminerende maatregelen weer teruggedraaid door andere regeringen 
Zo werd Tamil een officiële taal Toch ging de oorlog verder met vele doden tot 
gevolg Na Noorse bemiddeling werd in een staakthetvuren gesloten Daarna werd er onderhandeld maar de 
Tamiltijgers staakten de onderhandelingen in omdat de regering volgens hen niet genoeg goede wil toonde 
Toen in december een tsunami Sri Lanka overspoelde en veel gebouwen en infrastructuur vernielde laaiden 
de spanningen weer op De hulp die Sri Lanka kreeg mocht van de Tamiltijgers niet 
naar hun gebied waardoor de Tamils het zonder hulp moesten stellen In laaide het geweld 
weer op in korte tijd vielen er doden bij gevechten tussen de Tamiltijgers en regeringstroepen 
Daarom werden weer onderhandelingen gevoerd in Genève maar die leverden niets op Hierna werd de 
oorlog hervat en kwam een einde aan het staakthetvuren van De Tamiltijgers bezetten toen een 
sluis waardoor burgers zonder water kwamen te zitten Als vergelding bombardeerde de luchtmacht een wapenopslagplaats 
onder een school in Tamilgebied waarbij naast een groot aantal Tamiltijgers ook een aantal meisjes 
omkwam De onstabiele situatie remt de economische ontwikkeling van Sri Lanka enorm Mensenrechtenorganisaties signaleren dat 
mensenrechten door beide partijen geschonden worden Noorse bemiddelingspogingen hebben niet veel effect gehad In laaide 
het conflict weer op waarbij het regeringsleger al snel terreinwinst wist te boeken De stad 
Kilinochchi dat als de officieuze hoofdstad van de Tamiltijgers gold werd veroverd op januari en 
op mei gaven de restanten van de Tamiltroepen zich gewonnen Beschuldigingen van oorlogsmisdrijven vooral in 
de laatste maanden van de burgeroorlog werden geuit tegen zowel de Tamiltijgers als tegen het 
leger van Sri Hoewel de eerste beschuldigingen van genocide tegen de Tamils al in waren 
bleef er onenigheid of de misdrijven ook als genocide konden beschouwd worden Het Permanent Volkerentribunaal 
sprak in nog zijn twijfel uit maar besloot in dat het wel degelijk het geval 
was Het totaal aantal slachtoffers is moeilijk te bepalen Een VNwaarnemer acht een dodentol van

King's Quest Quest for the Crown ook gekend als King's Quest is het allereerste grafische 
avonturenspel dat animatie bevat Het spel kwam uit in voor IBM PCjr onder de naam 
King's Quest Het verhaal en ontwerp komt van Roberta Williams Het spel werd uitgebracht door 
Sierra Entertainment De subtitel Quest for the Crown werd pas toegevoegd toen het spel in 
werd heruitgebracht Deze subtitel wordt echter in het spel zelf nergens vermeld Enkel op de 
doos waarin het spel zat stond King's Quest Quest for the Crown In de originele 
versie uit is het verhaal eenvoudig Het koninkrijk Daventry heeft te kampen met rampen Het 
zijn er moeilijke tijden om te leven Koning Edward roept zijn koenste ridder bij hem 
Sir Grahame Grahame dient op zoek te gaan naar drie legendarische schatten welke de problemen 
zullen oplossen Indien hij slaagt zal hij koning In latere spellen en heruitgaves werd de 
naam Grahame aangepast naar Graham Toen het spel in werd uitgebracht voor IBM PC en 
Apple II werd het achterliggend verhaal uitgebreid Het koninkrijk Daventry heeft zware problemen nadat drie 
magische voorwerpen werden verwijderd uit het kasteel In een magische spiegel die de toekomst voorspelt 
zagen de koning en zijn vrouw ooit een visioen over een jonge man die koning 
wordt Ze gingen er verkeerdelijk van uit dat deze man hun toekomstige zoon is Omdat 
ze zich door de spiegel bedrogen voelden schonken ze deze aan een tovenaar Jaren later 
wanneer de koningin ziek is komt een dwerg met de belofte dat de wortels van 
een bepaalde plant haar zullen redden De dwerg wil de plant gaan zoeken maar heeft 
daarvoor 'het beschermende schild van Daventry' nodig De koning gaat akkoord maar de dwerg loog 
en keert niet meer terug De gezondheidstoestand van de koningin gaat achteruit en ze sterft 
uiteindelijk De koning gaat op zoek naar een nieuwe vrouw Hij redt de mooie prinses 
Dahlia uit Cumberland en trouwt met haar Zij blijkt echter een lelijke heks te zijn 
en gaat er na het huwelijk met de 'de onuitputtelijke gouden schatkist' van Daventry vandoor 
Het kasteel en het land Daventry geraken in verval Koning Edward roept zijn koenste ridder 
tot zich Sir Graham Graham moet op zoek gaan naar de drie verloren voorwerpen Omdat 
de koning geen navolging heeft zal Graham zijn opvolger worden indien hij slaagt in de 
King's Quest is het eerste grafische avonturenspel met interactieve fictie Oorspronkelijk toonden avonturenspellen enkel tekst 
op het scherm De speler diende via het toetsenbord commando's in te geven Later werden 
de avonturenspellen uitgebreid met statische tekeningen Pas met King's Quest werd het concept van animatie 
toegevoegd en kon de speler het hoofdpersonage daadwerkelijk besturen en acties laten uitvoeren Commando's dienden 
nog wel manueel ingegeven te worden via het toetsenbord Verder was King's Quest ook een 
van de eerste spellen dat op PC PCjr en Tandy een kleurenpalet gebruikte Computers met 
een CGAkaart konden ook kleuren tonen op voorwaarde men een kleurenmonitor of televisie gebruikte met 
behulp van een composietvideokabel Indien men enkel RGB gebruikte toonde het spel kleuren Het spel 
gebruikte vectorafbeelding omdat voorgerendeerde bitmaps te veel plaats innemen op diskettes Bij een vectorafbeelding wordt 
elk scherm realtime opgebouwd en ingekleurd Pas vanaf King's Quest V wordt gebruikgemaakt van bitmaps 
King's Quest werd uitgebracht in ter promotie van de nieuwe IBM PCjr Het was het 
eerste spel dat werd gemaakt met AGI Sierra's interne ontwikkeltool King's Quest was een ambitieus 
risocovol en duur project voor zijn tijd De meeste computerspellen werden door één programmeur geschreven 
in assembly over een periode van enkele weken Wanneer men besliste om het spel uit 
te brengen voor een ander soort van computer diende men het spel opnieuw te herschrijven 
in de assembly van dat computermodel Bij King's Quest waren er voltijdse programmeurs die maanden 
nodig hadden om het spel te maken Geschat wordt dat de ontwikkeling van het spel 
Amerikaanse dollar bedroeg Net omdat het spel animatie bevatte was het zo goed als onmogelijk 
om enkel gebruik te maken van assembly Vandaar dat Sierra een interne script engine maakte 
AGI Adventure Game Interpreter Een bijkomend voordeel van AGI was dat men het spel nu 
eenvoudig kon porten naar andere systemen Omdat de IBM PCjr flopte viel de verkoop van 
King's Quest tegen Dankzij de AGIinterface kon Sierra het spel op zeer korte termijn ook 
uitbrengen voor Tandy IBM PC en Apple II Dit werd wel een groot succes In 
werd het spel herontwikkeld met de AGI enginge en opnieuw uitgebracht voor DOS waarbij gebruik 
werd gemaakt van bootdiskettes Tezelfdertijd verscheen het spel voor het eerst op Amiga Atari ST 
en daarna op Sega Master System De AGI was sterk verbeterd Deze engine maakte geen 
gebruik meer van een tekstparser maar wel van point and click De nieuwe bootversie van 
DOS mist enkele geluidseffecten Ook werd met de AGI gebruikgemaakt van offscreen buffering Met AGI 
zag de gebruiker hoe het scherm werd opgebouwd en werden objecten een voor een opgebouwd 
en ingekleurd Hierdoor zag de speler al voorwerpen die uiteindelijk verborgen kwamen te liggen Ter 
illustratie als achter een boom bijvoorbeeld een hark verborgen ligt dan zag de speler in 
AGI hoe de hark werd opgebouwd en hoe er vervolgens een boom voor de hark 
werd getekend De speler wist dus dat er een hark achter de boom lag In 
AGI wordt eerst het ganse speelveld in het geheugen van de computer getekend en pas 
dan getoond De speler weet dus niet meer dat er achter die boom een hark 
ligt Verrassend genoeg kwam King's Quest niet uit op Commodore terwijl dit een van de 
meest gebruikte computers was Volgens Roberta Williams was dit een bewuste keuze omdat de resolutie 
van de Commodore te beperkt was en men niet tot het gewenste detail kon gaan 
Verder had de commodore slechts kilobyte aan geheugen wat te weinig zou zijn om de 
AGIengine te kunnen gebruiken King's Quest I Quest for the Crown werd in opnieuw geprogrammeerd 
ditmaal met SCIontwikkeltool Deze interpreter werd ook gebruikt voor onder andere King's Quest IV Hoewel 
de heruitgave nog steeds kleuren had werd de resolutie van de tekeningen verdubbeld en werd 
support toegevoegd voor geluidskaarten zoals AdLib en Sound Blaster Het spelverloop is geen exacte kopie 
van het originele Het verhaal werd sterk uitgebreid en er werden cutscenes toegevoegd In tegenstelling 
tot het originele spel moet de speler nu eerst op zoek gaan naar de 'onuitputtelijke 
gouden schatkist' en de 'magische spiegel van de toekomst' Pas dan kan hij op zoek 
gaan naar 'het beschermdende schild van Daventry' Veel personages kregen een beduidend grotere rol en 
tekst en ook nieuwe personages werden geïntroduceerd Sommige puzzels kregen een alternatieve oplossing of werden 
verwijderd De locatie van sommige voorwerpen werd ook aangepast Zo vindt de speler in het 
originele spel de keien aan de rivier In de remake liggen deze aan het meer 
Andere locaties werden gerestyled zo hebben de bergen geen trappen meer maar wel een opgaande 
weg Ook de soundtrack werd gedeeltelijk aangepast De remake werd echter slecht onthaald door critici 
en werd vergeleken met het inkleuren van klassieke zwartwitfilms Omwille van deze redenen werden de 
andere spellen uit de reeks niet heruitgebracht De versie voor Sega Master System verscheen in 
en gebruikt zijn eigen gameengine Het spel kwam rechtstreeks uit als point and click aangezien 
deze spelconsole standaard geen toestenbord heeft om de commando's in te typen Het spel werd 
gedistribueerd door Parker Brothers Verder wijkt ook dit spel af van het originele uit er 
zijn extra plaatsen waar de speler kan sterven savegames zijn beveiligd met een wachtwoord Wel 
kan men in dit spel de drie schatten in een willekeurige volgorde zoeken In bracht 
AGD Interactive een officieuze remake uit van het spel uit De resolutie werd opgedreven naar 
VGA en er werd gebruikgemaakt van een Ook de tekstinterpreter werd vervangen door een interface 
zoals gebruikt in King's Quest V Verder kwam het spel uit op cdrom en werd 
het volledig ingesproken De stem van King Graham werd ingesproken door Josh Mandel die ook 
door Sierra werd ingehuurd om Graham in te spreken voor King's Quest V en King's

De kleine wintervlinder Operophtera brumata is een algemeen voorkomende onopvallende kleine spanner Het is een 
van de weinige nachtvlindersoorten die in de winter vliegt De vleugels van het mannetje zijn 
ongeveer lang De vrouwtjes zijn vleugelloos en hebben alleen de voor de vrouwtjes zo kenmerkende 
halfontwikkelde vleugelstompjes; er is dus sprake van seksueel dimorfisme De kleine wintervlinder komt voor in 
heel Nederland en België in tuinen parken loofbossen boomgaarden en andere bosrijke gebieden De mannetjes 
vliegen gewoonlijk pas uit na de eerste nachtvorsten vanaf oktober tot en met december Ze 
vliegen hoofdzakelijk in de avondschemering bij vochtig en nevelig weer en bij een temperatuur tussen 
en De vrouwtjes bevinden zich op takken en boomstammen en kruipen daar wat rond tot 
de mannetjes ze opzoeken en bevruchten De paring kan wel tot uur duren De mannetjes 
nemen de vrouwtjes tijdens de paring soms mee in de Ze leggen in de winter 
hun eitjes verspreid over verschillende bladknoppen In het vroege voorjaar komen de eerste rupsen uit 
Ze eten jonge bladeren van diverse boomsoorten en zijn dus polyfaag De rupsen kunnen in 
sommige jaren door hun grote aantallen schade veroorzaken aan vruchtbomen Half juni kruipen de rupsen 
diep in de strooisellaag om te verpoppen De mannetjes ontpoppen vaak als eerste in oktober 
of november Zij vliegen al rond als de vrouwtjes uitkomen en de bomen in kruipen 
De kleine wintervlinder drinkt geen nectar en eet niet maar teert op de reserves die 
in het rupsenstadium zijn Rups Eitjes Vrouwtje De kleine wintervlinder is een van de vlinders 
die verantwoordelijk is voor de "rupsenpiek" in het voorjaar die ervoor zorgen dat vogels als 
de koolmees en de bonte vliegenvanger aan extra veel voeding kunnen komen Door stijging van 
de temperatuur bleken op zeker moment de rupsen echter al uit het ei te komen 
voordat er blad aan de eiken was heeft echter aangetoond dat door de genetische variatie 
de wintervlinder erin slaagt om bij dezelfde temperatuur toch vijf tot tien dagen later uit 
het ei te komen dan in de jaren De dieren die later uitkomen hebben een

Een ingrediënt is in algemene zin een bestanddeel van een mengsel Specifieker wordt van ingrediënten 
gesproken bij de bereiding van voedsel maar ook cosmetica geneesmiddelen bestaan uit meerdere ingrediënten De 
ingrediënten van een product en hun onderlinge interactie bepalen de eigenschappen van het eindproduct Bij 
voedselbereiding zijn ingrediënten de in een recept genoemde bestanddelen die noodzakelijk zijn voor de bereiding 
van het betreffende gerecht Op verpakte voedingsmiddelen moet volgens de Europese verordening nr een ingrediëntendeclaratie 
worden afgedrukt Deze verordening is in Nederland verwerkt in het warenwetbesluit informatie waarbij het Warenwetbesluit 
Etikettering van levensmiddelen kwam te vervallen De ingredientendeclaratie is een opsomming van alle ingrediënten die 
de fabrikant in het product heeft De lijst met ingrediënten staat in een voorgeschreven volgorde 
de ingrediënten met het hoogste aandeel in het product qua gewicht staan als eerste genoemd 
Daarbij moeten allergenen extra duidelijk worden Bijvoorbeeld kunnen zij dik gedrukt worden Op het etiket 
staan ook de voedingsadditieven Ook buiten de EU bestaat in veel landen een verplichting om 
de ingrediënten van voeding aan te geven In de VS bestaat bijvoorbeeld de Nutrition Labeling 
and Education Cosmeticaingrediënten worden gebruikt voor het samenstellen van een cosmetisch product De gebruikte ingrediënten 
worden op de verpakking afgedrukt zodat gebruikers die bepaalde ingrediënten willen of moeten vermijden hiervoor 
de vereiste informatie krijgen De naamgeving van de ingrediënten is volgens de INCIindeling Cosmetica bevatten 
vaak tientallen stoffen elk met een of meerdere functies voor het eindproduct Zo bevatten cosmetica 
kleurstoffen geurstoffen UVfilters in geval van producten tegen zonnebrand en hydraterende vetzuren Naast de actieve 
ingrediënten bevatten cosmetica hulpstoffen zoals antiklontermiddelen middelen die voor een goede smeerbaarheid zorgen of die 
de houdbaarheid verbeteren zoals conserveermiddelen antioxidanten en emulgatoren Tandapasta bevat vaak fluoride als ingrediënt Net 
als voor voeding bestaan er binnen de Europese Unie regels voor de ingrediënten van cosmetica 
namelijk de Europese Cosmeticaverordening waaraan sinds juli alle producten op de markt aan moeten Er 
is een wetenschappelijk comité opgericht het SCCS Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety dat adviseert over 
de veiligheid van cosmeticaproducten en De verordening bevat een lijst van ingrediënten die niet in 
beperkte mate of onder strenge voorwaarden in cosmetica mogen worden gebruikt Er geldt een verbod 
op het gebruik van stoffen die kankerverwekkend zijn mutageen of giftig voor de voortplanting De 
verordening bevat ook een lijst van toegestane kleurstoffen conserveringsmiddelen en In de farmacie zijn ingrediënten 
de bestanddelen van een medicijn Daarbij wordt onderscheid tussen de werkzame stof en allerlei hulpstoffen 
Bij producten die door mengen en roeren worden verkregen zoals verf inkt en schoonmaakmiddelen zijn 
de ingrediënten de verschillende bestanddelen waar deze producten uit zijn opgebouwd Ook deze worden op

m kan bereiken terwijl de stam een doorsnede van cm kan hebben De kroon heeft 
de vorm van een slanke kegel De takken groeien vanaf de stam horizontaal of enigszins 
omhoog ombuigend met afhangende zijtakken Er komen aan de takken twee soorten scheuten voor tussen 
cm lange scheuten waarin verschillende knoppen zitten en één tot twee mm lange scheuten waarin

kleur en worden bij het rijpen donkerbruin Ongeveer tot maanden na de bestuiving openen de 
kegels om de zaden te verspreiden Ook nadat de zaden losgelaten zijn blijven de kegels 
vaak nog jaren aan de boom vastzitten om dan een vaalgrijze kleur te krijgen Het 
verspreidingsgebied van Larix griffithii grenst in het westen aan dat van de verwante soort Larix

rechtop en is diep verdeeld in vijf ongelijke spatelvormige lobben De bloemkroon is tot lang 
lichtpaars met bleekgeel gehemelte min of meer buisvormig achteraan uitlopend in een kort kegelvormig spoor 
naar voor openend met twee bloemlippen een bovenste tweelobbige lip en een onderste drielobbige Het 
gehemelte sluit de buis niet volledig af Er zijn vier meeldraden en een bovenstandig vruchtbeginsel 
De vrucht is een doosvrucht De kleine leeuwenbek bloeit van juni tot oktober De kleine 
leeuwenbek komt vooral voor op open zonnige matig droge tot vochtige matig voedselrijke plaatsen vooral 
op kalkrijke en zandige bodems en dikwijls op verstoorde bodems zoals in akkers en moestuinen 
op spoorwegbermen dijken en rivieroevers in steengroeven op kalkrotsen oude muren puinhellingen en kleiwanden De 
plant komt voor in heel Europa behalve in het hoge noorden en in ZuidwestAzië In 
België is de plant plaatselijk vrij algemeen zowel in Vlaanderen als in Wallonië in Nederland 
plaatselijk vrij algemeen in Limburg het rivierengebied en in Zeeland elders zeldzaam De kleine leeuwenbek

Irwin Bazelon voltooide zijn Symfonie nr in Deze vierde symfonie wijkt geheel af van alle 
andere symfonieën in de reeks te vinden in de Lijst van vierde symfonieën Niet zo 
vreemd als men beschouwt dat de leermeesters van Bazelon Paul Hindemith en Darius Milhaud waren 
Het werk lijkt niet te wortelen in de tradities van de klassieke muziek en ook 
niet in die van de eeuw De basis van deze symfonie lijkt terug te voeren 
op de bigbandmuziek en dan nog wel uit het tijdperk van de “vrije” jaren zestig 
Een vaste maatindeling lijkt er niet te zijn net zomin als vaste tempi Bijvoorbeeld tijdens 
een solostuk cadens voor de zeven slagwerkers in het eerste deel spelen ze in allerlei 
tempoaanduidingen naar een climax toe In deze cadens ontbreken de pauken die echter later een 
solostuk hebben Ook de andere stemmen lijken in dit deel een vrije rol te hebben 
De compositie bestaat uit drie delen ook hier ontbreken de klassieke termen de delen heten 
deel en Deel begint als een energiek deel vol tempo en maatwisselingen soli en samenspel 
totdat na een kwartier de bedaardheid intreedt De wilde passages zijn verdwenen en zijn vervangen 
door relatief lang aangehouden legatotonen De percussieinstrumenten zijn verdwenen Na enkele minuten vervalt het orkest 
weer in wild geraas Tegenover het wilde eerste deel staat het veel rustiger tweede deel 
In deel keert de onrust direct weer terug; energiek is het woord voor dit deel 
Een oplossend eind is er niet; het werk houdt midden in een crescendo in de 
percussie op Beide bronnen vermeldden geen datum van eerste publieke uitvoering Albany Records vermeldde daarbij 
nog dat het werk nog op haar eerste uitvoering wachtte eenzelfde lot als Bazelons symfonie 
nr Men kan derhalve aannemen dat anno het werk nog op haar première wacht Het 
eerste deel is wel uitgevoerd In februari speelde het Seattle Symphony onder leiding van Milton
